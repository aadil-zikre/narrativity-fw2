I was so excited to find out that Oro Valley was getting a Guadalajara, it's one of my favorite restaurants. However, after knowing a close friend that had a horrible experience there (shortly after opening) I've been hesitant on going here. I'm so glad we did, It seems that they have worked out their kinks because my husband, kids and I had a wonderful time. We were seated promptly (we arrived shortly after five on a Saturday) and our waiter (Javier) was very attentive through out the whole meal. The salsa was fantastic and is always a highlight (I do believe the only make table side salsa on weekends and during dinner). I had a house margarita which was really good, not overtly sweet or sour and a fair amount of tequila (I was glad I wasn't driving and I'm not a lightweight). I ordered the molcajete and it was perfectly cooked a bit spicy and came with a lot of guacamole and their house made tortillas. My husband had the Plato poncho villa and he said it was the best  carne asada he has ever had, it also came with an enchilada and chile relleno. Our boys had the kids meals, one quesadilla and one bean burrito both were exactly as expected. We had a great time and honestly I would have to make something up if I wanted to complain. I hope this kind of service continues.
