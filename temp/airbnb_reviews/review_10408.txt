My experience with Pacifico Hyundai was not a positive one. I was working with a negotiator who I hired to help me through the buying process. My negotiator set up an appointment for me through the manager of this location. I was supposed to go there for a test drive, plus an assessment of my current car's value. Easy in, easy out, and with intentions of buying a car if everything went smoothly. 

When I arrived and asked for the manager, he immediately passed me off to a sales rep and I knew things were not going to go as planned. When I sat down with the rep, she asked for my phone and email address, which I did not wish to give as I would not be doing any of the negotiation for the sale. This did not go over well. My test drive was pretty awkward and very short - I was reminded more than once that it was the last day of the month which made feel uncomfortable. I brought up the fact that my car was also supposed to be assessed and that was quickly shut down. 

After leaving, I immediately called my negotiator and asked that he find my car at another dealer; I simply did not feel comfortable there. One week later, I've got the car I want at the best price possible (spoiler alert: not from Pacifico).
