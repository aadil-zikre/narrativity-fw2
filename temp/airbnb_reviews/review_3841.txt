We recently visited Old Tucson studios and enjoyed it very much.  Yes, it might seem a little corny to some but the actors and employees are so nice to everyone and it really brought back the memories of the old westerns that I watched with my dad.  We thoroughly enjoyed the shows and especially the stage coach ride.  I don't know how the ladies did it with their long dresses and riding those coaches!!
