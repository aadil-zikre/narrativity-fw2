Well i honestly can't believe i walked into this place.....

For the past year or so i would go up the river with my brother's heading toward Tampa to enjoy a day out on the water and we would always pass the Beer Shed and a couple things would ALWAYS stand out. As we would pass we would wave at the folks sitting on the patio and they NEVER waved back  and im talking numerous times this happened  Second thing that stood out.... they had the confederate flag waving through the air so i guessed that's why folks weren't so friendly to me and my brothers. 

Side note: my brother wrote a comment on their facebook page asking why do they fly that flag and he received hundreds of nasty and racially charged comments that still continue to this day from loyal customers.

So fast forward to today and we are coming back from rolling up the river and my brother wants to stop in for a quick drink so pull up and man what an eerie vibe when we walked in smh it was almost like the music stopped when we hit the door because ALL eyes were directly on us three. The bartender rolled her eyes at us when we asked for tequila we didn't know they only serve beer. So just walked away from us lol as if we couldn't order anything else so we got up and left didn't even want to spend another second in this joint and the customers seemed happy to see us leave. I noticed a sign that said est 1960 smh i could only imagine the place back in those hateful days. And sad thing is my short visit here i still can feel that vibe in the air...

Beer Shed is a no go...
