My experience at Schlafly over the weekend was a little strange, to be honest. I sat down and ordered a club soda and some fish tacos. The tacos were brought over in less than five minutes which was a little suspect, but I was truly hungry and took my chances. They were actually edible and I was happy to have a somewhat healthy meal before flying home. 

I asked for the check and my server offered to give me a refill of my club soda in a to-go cup, which was very nice. My bill came to nineteen dollars and some change; I put thirty on the table. My server came by and picked up the check and cash, said she appreciated me, and was off. I started to realize after a few minutes that she wasn't coming back. I don't mean to sound cheap, but I wasn't about to leave a fifty percent tip, either! I basically had to hunt down said server by the kitchen to ask for some change. It was awkward! Next time, I'm eating before I get to the airport.
