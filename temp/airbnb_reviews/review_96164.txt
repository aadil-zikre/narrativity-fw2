I've been hearing about this place for some time and knew that as soon as my warranty was up on my vehicle, I'd be taking my car for service there.  It's close to home, it seems like Ricky and everyone there are really nice and are all about honest customer service.

Prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I priced out brakes at the dealer (where all work on my car had previously been done - including all oil changes) and they saved me a ton of money and time!  I also sorta needed new rotors on the front and an oil change.  Adding those wasn't terribly much more and since they had the wheels off and changing the brakes, might as well do the rotors while we're there...

The first set of rotors that got replaced I noticed a shake immediately upon braking and kept driving to make sure I wasn't imagining things and then had to travel out of town and over the next few days it wasn't as bad, but was still there.  When I got back in town, I called Ricky and he said bring it in and as they warranty their work, they would take a look and sure enough he felt it too.  Replaced the rotors with new ones and voila! it surely did fix the problem and the car is smooth as silk when braking now!

They really did a great job, I'm happy so far with my first experience and based on the constant glowing reviews (not just here) I am a customer...so far, for life!  :)
