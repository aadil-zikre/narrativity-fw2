And I think I like to try in some people like to be able to vent their opinion , even though they know it 'll be unpopular and they can kind of get validation from when I post it on my one anonymously for them and people start voting.

So we 've got cert if there are certain events or if we know that we 've got certain products that are coming in or if we know we 're low on stock of something because it 's quite it 's quite funny when we 're low on stock on stuff. We make sure that we do n't shout about it too much because we have Got enough of it to go around anyway , and we do n't it 's such an annoying thing when people say well you do n't have any of these in stock. So that was n't very good. So we have a month month lease or meeting where we do plan out very vaguely plan out what we want to talk about then every Monday , we will then sort of like look at it and say , right. Okay. Yeah. So this week we do need to talk about this this this and this and then again my favorite kind and what I think I 'm quite good at It is the completely off the cuff random day-to-day stuff. We 're all of a sudden and this is this is brilliant to do for for anybody when they 're using their marketing you can spot if you spot a trend or something that everyone 's talking about
