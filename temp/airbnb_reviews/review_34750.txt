Took my Miele vacuum to this location for routine maintenance that includes disinfected and deodorizing the vacuum, and cleaning inside and out using high pressure air through motor and interior. They had the vacuum for a week and it looks like they did NOTHING but replace the vacuum bag. When I got home I opened the vacuum from the bottom and sides to find the vacuum filled with dirt and dust that could have easily been removed with high pressure air (pictures attached). I could tell the vacuum was never opened as chunks of dust and dirt were falling out. Stay away from this business and please do yourself a favor to never get your vacuumed serviced here as it's the biggest scam.
