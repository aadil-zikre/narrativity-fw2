I've been going to J's with my car for about a year after being raked over the coals time and time again from a dealership getting extra work done to my car when all I wanted was an oil change.  Not only can they pick up my car from my work, since I work in the local area, their prices are affordable and I really appreciate their honesty. It's been a refreshing change and I appreciate their help. I can't see going anywhere else.
