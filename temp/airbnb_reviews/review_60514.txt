That time of the year we all dread... no, not taxes...Lol! Actually, what I'm talking about is having to take our vehicles down to the smog station in order to get your car registered. 

We have been coming here for years but this visit felt kind of awkward. What I mean is that the owners usually take care of us and are very welcoming from the moment we pull up to the moment we leave but on this visit the owners (older gentlemens) were not there and we were helped by a couple of younger employees that I have never seen before. They didn't seem very comfortable with the business process and not very welcoming.

I get it, not everyone is a conversationalist but if someone is hired and put in charge to run a business; it is important that you engage with your customers in some positive manner. If all a person did was say hello and smiled...that in itself would promote good business but at their rate; this place will slowly lose business.

One of the things I have always liked about this place is that they are a one stop shop and especially the owners (older gentlemens). I have never had to wait very long and they have the ability to smog and take care of your registration so that you don't have to deal with going down to the DMV...Blah!

I will need to smog one of our other vehicles in a few months and I'm willing to come here again to give them another shot but if these same people are there; I will take my business elsewhere. This particular visit was on a Saturday so next time I go; I will head down during the weekday which is when I have gone in the past and was able to deal with the owners.... Overall, the experience was okay because I came here to smog/register my vehicles and that was accomplished... Oh, and thanks for my yearly pen. (You know what I'm talking about if you have ever been here...Lol)
