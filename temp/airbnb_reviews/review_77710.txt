I had a great time at the 14th Annual Music City Brewer's Fest. After attending a few times over the first few years, this was my first time back in a while. The event, like the beer scene in Nashville, has grown by leaps and bounds. 

I saw pretty much every local brewer there -- Mayday was perhaps the only one I don't recall seeing. Many of them even sent out their brewmaster and/or owner to chat with the festival goers and share a sample. 

There were also a bevy of food options and other vendors/promotional tents. Exit Realty was out there with a camera trying to get people to buy or sell their houses, Nashville Armory had a Colt Python-esque smoker fired up selling barbecue and merchandise, including .50 BMG-shaped cigar tubes (with cigar!), and of course, lead sponsor Mafiaoza's was out there slinging slices of their signature pies. 

While I was initially concerned about the relatively small area of Walk of Fame Park, the breaking up of sessions meant that while crowded, the space was not sardine can tight, which is one of the reasons I stopped attending many of the beer fests in this town, so kudos to the organizers for managing that. 

About the only negative I can mention is that it seemed like many of the breweries in attendance did not bring anything particularly interesting. I, like many beer festival goers, go to events like this one to try something new. Especially harder-to-get offerings or new releases -- I'm not paying a premium price to come and drink exactly the same thing I can always find at my local bar or beer store. 

In short, this is one of the better run beer festivals in this town, and I always recommend it to friends and visitors. I think the VIP options are usually the best experience/value equation, but if you only go to one session, I recommend the earlier one, as it's usually less expensive, less crowded, and they haven't run out of anything yet.
