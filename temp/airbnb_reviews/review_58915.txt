This is a  great place to go for a run, I love running and this is a perfect place to just enjoy myself and let all the worries fall of my back, once I start running, nothing else matters.  I aggree with Corey about the fact that there aren't any fountain drinks around the park, however for me specifically, that motivates me to finish my run a little faster. Going for a run in the middle of the night may be a bit dangerous, but I find that, this is the best time to do it because it is almost empty if not empty at all. 
Even during a cold night it is still really good go running in the middle of the night. Perhaps I just like a little bit the element of dangerous that keeps me going back.
I think that  people should be proud of such a great landmark and keep it clean. especially those people who walk their dogs and do not clean after their pets, that is such disrespect not only for the community but for all the dog owners not just the ones who do not clean after their pets.
