Barre3 is the best thing that's ever happened in my fitness life!!! Owner Holly and the amazing teachers (Molly, Jennie Rebecca, Margy, Gloria to name a few  I have taken class with) will  make you so comfortable  and happy while you are breaking a sweat and sculpting long , lean muscles.

Personally I have tried everything to get my legs looking awesome.  I have always been a runner, and I tried supplementing with lifting, kickboxing, hot yoga, boot camp classes, you name it and I tried it. This is the first method of exercise that has not only been 100% safe for my wonky lower back, but has defined and toned my legs exactly how I've always wanted! It is an AMAZING compliment to create flexibility and strength for runners, but would be suitable for pretty much anyone to get a great workout.

As a performer, I'm always conscious of making sure I wear flattering clothes on stage. Now after just two months of coming to Barre3, I'm rocking my shortest cutoffs and boots without a care in the world and feeling really proud to show off my Barre3 legs.

These ladies know what they are talking about! They are so knowledgeable about working through injuries and can give modifications for every body type and walk of life. I can't say enough good things about this amazing practice of exercise that combines yoga, Pilates, and traditional barre. I'm so happy and energized every time I walk out of class, and my back has actually gotten better!! 

You won't regret trying this amazing method of fitness, and you will love the friendly sense of community and positivity in this studio!
