I truly believe a work setting is a work setting no matter what kind of work you do, that being said a business should be staffed with professional people regardless the type of business you own. The way you carry your self as a person reflects on how you run your business and could make your product questionable especially it being in the food industry. Writing messages to women on a box of wings with the words "Enjoy Beautiful (happy face)" in bold silver marker ink shows how much class you have as a person which ultimately shows you don't care or treat your business with integrity which again makes your food questionable because if you don't care who you write these border line harassment messages to which could be a pastors wife, a police officers wife, or could be your own wife if the tables were turned then would leave me to believe that you wouldn't care if one of your wings fell to the ground and still sold it to a customer. I highly suggest you stop putting these sexist comments on boxes to those you find attractive before I do everything in my power to make this picture go rival. Grow up!
