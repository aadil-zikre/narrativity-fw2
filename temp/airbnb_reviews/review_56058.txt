I really like the convenience of this car wash. If you've ever read any of my reviews you know I love a drive through! 3 times I've come and got a car washed and didn't even stop to get the included vacuum because I'm lazy (and half the time not presentable enough to get out of the car and be seen)...and those won't be my last.

What I Love:
- easy in and out...it's not a tight squeeze (a lot of car washes aren't on as much land so it feels so tight getting in and out of the wash) 
- free vacuum area (I've only used it once out of the 4 times I washed a car here) easy to use and for as long as you wish with plenty of space
- Nice and clean...I think only 1 or 2 attendants are on duty, but it's kept very clean (it's also brand new)
- many wash options...the wax and tire shine options really work. I've been to other drive thru washes where you can't tell the difference, but I've had people compliment my wax job and HubbyStanks thought I took the car to a full service wash when he saw the wheels were shiny! 
- you smell the clean soap on your car as you drive out
- conveniently located at the non-busy part of Hillsborough at Double Branch Road. 
- I don't know if I'll need it but they have an unlimited wash specials starting at $19. Worth it if you like to get a wash once a week...but I tend to drive dirty for 3 weeks to a month.
