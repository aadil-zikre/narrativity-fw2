Used to love this store and have bought many many pieces over the years from the pink  fireplace bench, the blue metal cabinet, China, Waterford pieces, cake plates, napkin rings, fostoria, knife rests, etc etc.

Went to both shops today and encountered the daughter in the main shop. She was talking g very loudly to a man, making racist comments about the "mexicans" the "chinese", etc and how it is so unfortunate that we have to be so inclusive...it went in for several minutes and the man with her was agreeing with her. 

We.just ended up turning around and leaving. 

However, we decided to return to the other store down the street to let the mother/owner know that her daughter's behavior cost her two of her best customers. 

The mom just defended the daughter's behavior and comments...stating...you dont understand having to do business in this neighborhood with them...how offensive...the apple didnt dall far from the tree in this case.

Too bad because the shop is great and we always find a few things to buy every time we go in there, but I cant support racist behavior and folks running a business need to realize that  not all their customers share their beliefs and they shouldn't be shouting about their racist opinions in front of their customers....
