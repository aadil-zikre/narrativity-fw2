I went online about 6 months ago to schedule a test drive, Donnie was the person that contacted and help me out, we went ahead and had a good time driving an used Q5. 5 month later when I am ready to buy a car, he found a used one for me as specifically as I expected ( w/ navigation, bang and olufsen speakers, gray color). It is a beautiful car w/o the appreciation values. As a Certified pre-owned car, the after-sales service will be more critical, but the salesperson and finance manager, Donnie and Neil, they are both very friendly and fun to work with, both have the great sense of humors and knowledge about the services they provided. As a first car buyer, I had lots of questions but they all being very knowledgeable, provided the options for me. It was a great experience with them!
