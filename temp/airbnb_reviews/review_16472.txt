I live in a single two-story in a modest lower-middle-class neighborhood in Upper Darby, south of Lansdowne.  I needed serious landscaping of part of my back yard, basically I wanted a sit-down-and-relax-in home "park".  I tried to engage two mainline landscaping companies but, though they visited, they discovered my project would not net them the big bucks they were used to; thus, they ignored me afterwards.

Via a Google search I discovered EcoLandscapes and liked the dedication to the environment and its design philosophy.  The owner, Dan Cleary, visited and did NOT ignore me like the others.  We shared ideas and he came up with a sketch of my future garden--I couldn't even get a sketch out of the other two.

A date was set and kept and Dan and a crew team leader, Mike, regularly checked for my approval of their implementation of the approved design.  There were several minor revisions through the 4.5 days, and the final product is very pleasing to the eye and low maintenance and perennial, as wanted--with various foliage colors, leaf textures and contrasting sizes.  Both Dan and his crew's team leader continually sought feedback.

On top of all this, The company guarantees the plantings for one year and provides a portable (fancy) sprinkler system and soaker hoses (part of the price) to insure their handiwork continues to give pleasure.
