There's only one thing that keeps this service center from being a 5 star review, and that because Comcast closed most local branches, leaving this one to be pretty much a regional service center... Bring your patience. The amount of people sitting around inside reminds me of going to the DMV.. Once inside, check in at one of the tablets, and it places your name on a list in the order that you arrived. You can also choose to add your cell number to receive a text when you're next in line... This is something I took advantage of. I left my number, went back to my car and drove to a bank to take care of some other business, and received a text shortly after I got back to the service center. 
The customer service rep was pleasant and proactive as far as being helpful and looking at my account to see how I could save money based on what package I have and what features I pretty much don't use... An overall good experience.
