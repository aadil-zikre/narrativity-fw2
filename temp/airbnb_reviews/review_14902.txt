Recently had to put my dog down, he was almost 17 years old.. everything went fine at the office and we got our dogs remains back rather quickly however..  Someone at the office forgot to do my dogs paw print.. - Lead nurse pulled us in a private room when picking up the ashes and said "luckily we did not pay for it, & that it is a free service" - doesn't take the place of the fact that you forgot to do it & it was a memorial keepsake that we were expecting.  Please go to a place that won't forget to help keep your dogs memory alive.
