People say he 's actually not trying to stuff you into a suit. People say he 's trying to give you a heart attack. So the other ones can stuff you in a suit. Or else he would kill you with his hook because everyone knows he has a hook. And then yeah , but in the TV 's behind him , apparently they flash his arm as he like jerks into your office.
