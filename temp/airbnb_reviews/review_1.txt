It 's probably those for and when I may be one of the young guys at this point , well , yeah. Well , you know , I think if if if Jami and AJ can be your , you know , at least on par with your best option at Nick. Well , then , yeah , I think you know like you said is he and JC outside one of those two guys at nickel. I think RJ roderick 's definitely one of your best safeties and then I think eBay and jamyest are probably battling it out to be the other safety as far as your best five options. Yeah , because apparently I mean when I asked dries when we have medical availability last week , you said you know , he he expects to play safety, and Nick this year just sort of wherever it 's expected or wherever the team needs him. I just ca n't again. We just had it a second ago. They're not going to rep 6 nickels in practice but I am surprised at the coach's dedication to keeping him in safety seemingly. Well , I think he fits better there man. I mean even even his freshman year when he played so much nickel by the end. They were depending on match ups and down in distance. You could see they were swapping him and crystal mines between you know nickel and safety at times just they do n't want jamyest Williams matched up in Coverage with massive wide receivers so , you know when you 're at the nickel and you know , not everybody has a smaller slot guy only like your have teams are going to spread you out even with bigger receivers and if he 's playing free safety , he 's more free to sort of ROM the field and you know cover space covered grass as opposed to cover a person
