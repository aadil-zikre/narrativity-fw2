I've been to this store 4 times in the past 2 weeks, looking for a shirt they posted online saying they had new shipments with this shirt, and they never had it in. One of the employee's at this store is so rude, she stands in the same place every time I come in. If I ask this girl a question about anything she acts like I am troubling her and makes me feel like I'm an annoyance to her if I ask her a question. I'm to the point where I don't even want to go into the store because I feel like I'm bothering this girl if I can't find what is advertised.
