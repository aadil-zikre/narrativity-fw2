Gets the job done.

If you're looking for a weekend getaway in SB and won't be in your hotel room often but still want somewhere that will do more than leave the light on for you, this quaint hotel is just the spot.

Likes:
-dispensers for soap and shower products that are squeeze bottles (I have recently discovered a pet peeve of hotels that use bars of soap or the twist off cap style dispensers
-comfy bed
-spacious closet
-complimentary parking
-location (walkable to state street, right across from the pier, and a stone's throw away from the little street that has a couple wine tasting rooms)

Appreciate:
-complimentary coffee/tea station available at any time
-complimentary wine and cheese in the evening (I believe 5-7pm). While it may just be cubes of cheddar and pepper jack and carafes of what I assume to be cheap wine, it's a lovely gesture and a nice way to accompany the getting ready for the night process

Not a fan of:
-the bathroom window was at street level (facing the alley that other guests had to take to their room) but provided no proper blockage so we had to time our bathroom visits just so as to not give a peep show to any passersby 

Staff was nice and the rate was economical given that we shared the rate between three people.
