You would think this "company" would help you with purchases - I mean they are the biggest company in the country making sure China makes lots of money - well I wanted to buy a computer which was out of stock and the salesperson wasted my time because he had no idea what he was doing at all and just referred me to the website, went onto the website - they let me buy it and then sent me an email 12 hours later canceling the order because they were out of stock, they said that they had to hold my money for 3 business days - it was Saturday and I needed this computer fast so now my money was tied up into this stupid company. I called them thinking they could help me, compensate me hey maybe give me 10 % off - nope I spoke with a supervisor on the phone and he couldn't care less and also the other 3 operators I spoke with - they couldn't care less. I always said I wouldn't buy from Walmart because they are a horrible company - they treat their employees bad and doesn't barely sell any USA products - well I'm positive I'm done with them I'll go to target
