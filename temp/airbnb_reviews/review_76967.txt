I just moved to Indianapolis from Boston, so naturally one of the first things I had to do was to find the nearest Dunkin Donuts for my coffee fix.  This one seems to be pretty new and I have to say that the coffee lived up to my high Dunkin Donuts standards!  I've only gone through the drive through but I've found that the employees are so friendly and seem to really enjoy being at work.   Coming from a place where you got a large side of attitude along with your large coffee, this is such a nice change!  I was there two days in a row and they remembered me and my order- and that made me feel very welcome.   To me, it's worth the 5 minute drive out of my way to get my coffee from people who really seem to care about what they do- plus having that Dunkin Donuts cup in my hands makes me feel a little less homesick.
