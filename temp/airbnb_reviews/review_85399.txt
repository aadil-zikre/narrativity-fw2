My husband and I have been very fortunate to have mostly driven hand-me-down cars and so we have made it into our 30s without having gone through the car buying experience.  We were both a bit apprehensive about a heavy sales push or ending up with a car payment higher than we could afford.  The moment we walked into this Carmax we relaxed.  Our sales person Greg Crider was a warm, friendly, knowledgable, non-pushy and a consummate professional.  We ended up with a newer, better car than we thought we could afford (2010 Kia Soul) which we love!  Greg made our experience very positive and if we're in the market for another car we will go see him!  A car salesman you can trust is a treasure!
