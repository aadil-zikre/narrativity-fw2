Not entirely clear on when Wink's "World Famous Buttermilk Drop" was rebranded as Wink's "Bakery & Bistro," nor really as to how or why the French Quarter space and subsequent expansion to a local mall became "World Famous" in the first place, it was just past the eight o'clock opening that I entered the exposed brick and concrete floored space, glass cases not yet even filled as two young male voices could faintly be heard chatting in the distance.

Generally assuming a Donut shop opening after sunrise is not serious about their craft, the sleepy-eyed young man finally emerging from the back with a "what can I getcha," also suspect, it was with modern rock playing overhead that a few quick questions were answered, the dining-space filled with pictures of Wink empty save for myself throughout the next half-hour.

Wondering how far this generation of the eatery differed from Wink's original, the feeling far more 'hipster' than the stripped-down yet superb Buttermilk Drop Bakery & Caf√© on North Dorgenois Street, donuts selected included a Pudding-filled pocket that trended far too artificial alongside an Apple Fritter that was equally disappointing, the outside a bit too oily without any semblance of Fruit at its doughy center.

Finding a yeasted ring with Sugar crystals much better, the sweetened Cream Cheese frosting not dissimilar to that of the festive Fat Tuesday Cake, two of the formerly-eponymous orbs proved well-flavored with a bit of sourness beneath the glaze, though the crumb still fell short of nearby competitors by way of too-low an oil temperature which prevented the characteristic crispness around its edge.
