I've been going to Erin since we moved here from Southern California 7 months ago and can't recommend her highly enough! She is excellent and knows how to work with my hair's difficult, frizzy texture. I always leave feeling like a million bucks. I've even got my husband going to her and he has gotten so spoiled he won't go anywhere else now!
