Lovely and a wonderful compliment to VU campus!
Quality, thoughtful menu and service. Dishes are delicious. We had crab cakes, salmon, steak and chicken. All very good. Buttercake is scrumptious! Signature cocktails are fabulous. Love the casual but elegant atmosphere with great music. Such a welcomed addition to the Main Line!
