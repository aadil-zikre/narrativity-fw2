After years of being a loyal fan of Boston's in this space, I'm so happy that the great people who ran this location have not changed.

I stopped in this afternoon to make sure and found peace of mind that Tony and Sandy are fully in charge.

The name may have changed, but the interior looks the same and the menu actually has some new items now that Tony and Sandy have a little more freedom to do what they want.

Same two for one happy hour all damn day. Same discount for bringing in your AMC movie ticket. Same experience as before just without the corporate name.
