I do n't think I would be this critical at all. Even if she was purely like trying to sell products and whatever I 'd be like , okay. Well , at least this is her community like allyship in this form is gross to me because it feels very selective as you 're saying she tried on friend. And friendship as her marketing campaign , she tried on feminism with 1989 which is by the way an album. I really like hmm But with this it just felt like way over the top the songs not even good just to go there for a second the songs not interesting. It 's there 's no new colors on her in this what looks like her new album. Also , it 's called lover which just saying that word made me want to throw up in my mouth. Like I do n't want to hear this and it 's like why are you at ? Like I just ca n't like why are you at like a major site of queer history performing Shake It Off. I mean to some degree if we had a sense that that was what the people wanted that 's legitimate right ? But I do n't think that we have that sense. I want to share kind of a contrast. You know that this is one of my favorite passages from a book Sarah Kenzie. ER who is a really important intellectual on Twitter
