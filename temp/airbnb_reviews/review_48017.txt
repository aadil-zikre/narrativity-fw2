Set up an appointment to test drive a car, told them I was driving over an hour to get there. Get to the dealership to find out the car was sold over two hours ago by a large sales man who just laughs and walks away from me. Not going to be getting any of my business or a good review. Icing on the cake was the sales manager i spoke with earlier called me on my drive home to tell me the car was sold, and was later followed up by a woman who asked about how I liked the car I never got to drive. Thank you Acura of Limerick for wasting my time.
