IF I could give this place no stars then I would.  I normally never write reviews on places and I hate to give a business negative feedback but my friend was treated so poorly by the staff at this restaurant that I had to get on and spread the word.  

On 1/19/13 I placed a takeout order and my friend went to go pick it up for me as I wasnt feeling well at the time.  I ordered a salad and it came to $11.75.  All I had on me was $12.00 - which I thought would be fine as my friend was just going to run in and pick it up for me. 

However, apparently the staff at this restaurant believe that if your ordering takeout then you must leave a tip as well - and they made it VERY awkward. 

As my friend handed over the $12-00 to pay for my meal the girl behind the counter goes, " and here is your 25 cent change - you clearly need this more than I do." Aghast by the remark my friend asked her to please repeat what she just said (as she couldnt believe what she was hearing).  The girl hands my friend the quarter change and says, " Normally it is customary to tip your server - thats how things are done here."

I'm not sure how she thinks she is a "server" when my friend literally walked into the building to pick up the food.  But I do think perhaps she could kindly take her head out of her behind and learn some manners. 

NEVER GOING BACK.  And I will be sure to tell all of my friends.
