I think that the you know the in the books of Sorrow the worm Gods say There is a traveler and another agent of the light or an agent of the sky. Yeah talking about also the Leviathan. Yeah , I my opinion is that the traveler and the Leviathan and guardian are agents of the gardener. Guardians are a bit of a you know , but it 's actor one really quickly and that if pretty much specifically says like the gardener chose you and came to your system and resurrected you and trust you from death or feels like it 's very like pretty much painting a picture that the traveler is the gardener because it talks about this if we it coming to our system and specifically like Reviving us and choosing us. You want to know later cards ? It 's so what it says is I know we 're jumping ahead here. But it says it was the gardener the chose you from the but I but I mean the traveler did n't choose us from the debt the Trap the travel they did n't choose us but the traveler made the ghosts. Yeah reduce us. So what I 'm saying is there 's already that if the gardener is the traveler that 's already incorrect The Traveler did n't choose us from the dead the ghosts. Ghost shows us from the so because the the exact whether the garden hose you from the dead. I want to have done that. It 's just not in me. But now they have invested them self in you you are incredibly unique be special that wondering Refugee chose to make a stand spend their power to say here
