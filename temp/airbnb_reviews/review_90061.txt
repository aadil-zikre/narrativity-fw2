Big fan of this place! Fiance and I were looking for a sectional and an entertainment stand for our TV when we moved into our new apartment. This seemed like a big step up to us from Ikea where all of our other furniture was from. We were excited to think that we wouldn't have to put the furniture together with that silly little wrench and the pictures of the cartoon little men. Unfortunately upon delivery we noticed that our TV bench still needed to be assembled by hand, that was a disaster, the instructions may have been worse than Ikea's.

The reason why I give it 4 stars instead of less for furniture assembly is because of the sales associate who helped us to place our order. We went into the store knowing exactly what we wanted so it made the whole ordering process easy, what really made the visit special was Troy. Though there was a miscommunication in our order/delivery which required a re-delivery of our furniture, Troy was very professional in helping us sort out the issue. Not only was Troy a champ when it came to helping us with our furniture order, he remembered my fiance's name and where he played basketball making it a point to call us and ask if it was ok to pass along fiance's phone number to a customer that had come in saying that he had a local sports radio show and was looking for guests.

Depending on where you live in the city, this store is actually closer than the one up on Roosevelt Blvd...so if you're looking for affordable furniture a step above Ikea with a staff that genuinely wants to help make your living space look and feel like home, take a trip to this location, I doubt you'll be disappointed.
