My fianc and I were making Thai for dinner and we stopped by here to buy some fish sauce (there were 30 varieties) and some other ingredients that are harder to come by at Acme. The prices are really really cheap and once you get past the smell (think Chinatown in summer) and the fast that English is not their first, second, or even third language, its an adventure! We also bought a basil seed drink (I'd pass on that in the future) and some other goodies. We'll be back there for sure!
