We see our family. We see our relationships everything becomes seen through these lenses and therefore we 're seeing things as they appear to be according to our trauma lenses , but not As they really are. That is huge. And so I want to repeat that we see things or we experience our life according to the lenses that we see our life. And so what happens is that we experience life not as it really is but how it appears to be to us through our own thinking through our own condition beliefs through our own interpretations. I 'm so trauma recovery is really about uncovering. What 's already there ? We are not broken and as we peel away those conditioned beliefs. And we Embrace who we really are. Outside of those beliefs that we are whole that we 're not broken. Something changes within us and we begin to respond differently in new ways. in reality and that to me from my own personal experience is trauma recovery. I feel like a completely different person than I was , you know , even five years ago
