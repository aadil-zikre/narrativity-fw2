We have used Sleepy Hollow Pet Ranch for years and love them!  Anna is so wonderful with my big guy, who seems to get a little freaked out when its walk time. The also know that my little girl dog is aggressive towards other female dogs, so keep that in mind when they choose her kennel spot.  My dogs get all excited when they realize where we are pulling up to and cant wait to go in and see everyone.
