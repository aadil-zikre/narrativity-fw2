My husband and I checked this place out Sunday--what an asset to East Falls, and right around the corner from our place!  They seem to be working out the menu, but the food we ordered (nachos and poutine) was good, the staff was friendly, and the building was pleasant to be ing.

I don't know what the previous reviewer was talking about with respect to beer options--the tap list at this place is HEAVEN compared to most of the options in the area (the only one that I think I would rate higher is Falls Taproom, and that because they rotate and have more local options).  We enjoyed that there were 4-5 choices each for the standard stuff (bud, miller, etc), imports (spaten, etc) and craft beers (local options, seasonals, etc).  They had pumpkin beer on tap during the fall, which signals to me that they are trying to appeal to a more educated palate.

We will definitely be back--I hope to see some more local craft brews on there in the future!
