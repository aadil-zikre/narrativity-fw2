Our family has used Autoking for all of our car repairs for over 12 years. First and foremost, they are honest and always very transparent about what's going on with the vehicle. They have never been pushy about potential fixes/repairs and will even help us decide what repairs  we can hold off on. Butch and Jeremy know our family and it is always refreshing that they know and remember us as well. 

I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 because there has been a few times where service was a little slower, but overall we have been extremely happy with Autoking. An honest mechanic is hard to come by and their rates are always competitive, usually lower, than some corporate chains.
