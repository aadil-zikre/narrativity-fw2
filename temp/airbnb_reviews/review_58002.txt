"You not bleeding that bad... If you don't like, you don't come back". That's what 'Ellen' told me when I requested a manager after she cut me during a manicure and her solution was to put nail glue on it. When I objected to that she grabs nail polish remover to take it off. All of this could have been chalked up to "just one of those off days" had her attitude not been so God awful and I'm left with the worse mani/pedi known to man. If you're going to support this business request anyone other than Ellen!
