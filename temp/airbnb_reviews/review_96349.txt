I took my engagement diamond to be reset into lower set prongs. They CRACKED my diamond (yes, the diamond I've had since my husband and I were engaged 36 years ago!) Jared's offered to take responsibility and replace my diamond... to the tune of a $3,300 diamond for a $9,000 appraised and insured diamond! I refused and suddenly, two days later, they found a better one worth $3,900! I came to find out they were basing the replacement on my diamond based on limited information---they never even weighed my diamond before resetting it! Weight is crucial to the determination of value!!! I decided to file a claim with my own jewelry insurance company- which they advised against, citing an increase in premium and a deductible----neither of which came into play or would ever happen! Trying to get a letter stating they took responsibility for cracking the diamond (I have their promise to replace the diamond THEY cracked) took over one week- while I begged for on a daily basis. I wanted to move on with replacing my diamond. Proceed at your own risk if you go there; you won't be seeing me because I would never find the trust to go back!
