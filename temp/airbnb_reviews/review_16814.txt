I went for my first colonic last week and was a bit nervous at first, I almost chickened out but I'm so glad I didn't do that. 
Dr. Esther just puts you at ease before she begins the process. She thoroughly explained how the process works, why it's beneficial, what to expect to feel during and after the cleanse, and how to maintain the cleanse. 
I came away wanting to learn more about gut health in general and more about how the filtering organs work. 
The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. I have already signed up for more sessions and I'm excited to see how my energy, sleep, general mood changes as I complete more sessions.
