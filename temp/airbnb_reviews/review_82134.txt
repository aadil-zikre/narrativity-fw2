This place is a treasure trove of used, rare books. I spent some time walking around just marveling at the amount of books, but I was there to find something specific: a textbook for an upcoming class. 

It was super helpful that their website offers a database you can search before even arriving, which is how I knew they had the book I needed. The man working behind the register walked me to the section I needed and it was fun digging through the books to find my prize. 

Best part: the textbook that normally goes for $180 was $5 when I rung up. But even if you're not looking for something specific, I highly recommend browsing. It's a huge, awesome space with all sorts of unique books!
