I made my first visit to this BBQ pop-up last night and will be making time for future visits every week. In order to avoid the stress of decision making, I went for the 3 meat plate and ended up with 5 meats and 2 sides! ( "The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.")
Everything was great, all of the meat moist and fresh, the 3 sauces worked well with everything. The wet brisket and pulled pork were exceptional. 
Make it over to Couli's and get on with your own meat binge!
