The management at this place is beyond awful! I don't live here because of my walk-through with one of the leasing agents. The walk through was so terrible, I felt like I was a bother to her. She took a phonecall from her son's assistant principal and then proceeded to scream and curse at her son...ALL DURING MY WALK THROUGH! I filled out a survey expressing my dissatisfaction and horror and was never so much as sent an email apologizing or even acknowledging my terrible experience. I wouldn't live here if you paid me!
