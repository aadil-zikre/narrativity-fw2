Oh thank heaven for.... well you know the rest of the story, this one occupies one of the best corners off the ramp on I-275 at US 19 - it seemed to have a steady flow of customers during my recent visit to fill-up. The fuel prices were competitive, the housekeeping around the pumps left a little to be desired, the most disappointing being the empty sanitizer dispensers especially with what's going on in the world today. I have my own so it wasn't a big deal I just hate half-ass efforts, if you're going to provide a service provide it all the time or remove all evidence that you ever offered it.

I think this location is more about convenience rather than being a destination, I know for me it was by happenstance and honestly I didn't make a way point on my GPS. If you're running low on fuel (meaning your low fuel light is on) this may be a good option. I didn't enter the store so I haven't a clue about the staff some seem to have had a bad experience others praise their efforts - I'll take a neutral position on this one...
