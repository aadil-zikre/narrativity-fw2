I used to agree with the rest.... The Alley was the perfect place to go see a great punk rock show. My friend and I know a lot of musicians in the industry, especially in the punk scene, and we were stoked when we moved to Reno to find out that The Alley was the place to go for some of our favorite bands. We never name drop and rarely ask to be on guest lists, we hardly party (let alone go out), and we most definitely DON'T get into bar fights... so this night was a total bummer. Not only did some guy sucker-punch my friend in the face that night which lead to stitches and the ER until 3AM, but the perpetrators were apparently buddies of security and/or the owner and were allowed to stay and watch the show while we were kicked out! The jerks were later let go with no consequences after we waited for hours outside for some sort of justification from security. The worst part was that after I finally called the cops (when we realized the establishment wasn't going to do anything about my friends busted face) the two of us voluntarily took breathalyzers to document that my friend had 0.0% alcohol in his system in order to disprove the statement given by security and the owner of The Alley that my friend was "drunk" and that "he swung at a girl" and that we "Instigated" the fight. 
Um, I'm sorry, what fight? Oh, you mean how your buddies cheap-shotted us and then left scott-free? Yeah. We'll never be going back there. And we'll get the word out to friends about the unethical crap we endured on a night that we were out, like normal 30 year old adults, trying to have a good time.
