It was the positive reviews that brought me to this location where I bought new tires for three vehicles including warranties, come to find that I drove around for two months with one wheel missing the locking lug nut! When I brought the car in to address the issue and get it resolved, the manager,  KEN S blew me off like nothing happened and further behaved as if it was my fault that the lug nut was "missing." He offered zero apologies that they never placed it back on my wheel when they replaced the tires. In fact, he refused to take any accountability or to acknowledge that a mistake had been made. In his annoyed state, he took my number and said he will order one and call me when he has it! The staff was very nice and even began looking for it around the shop, but the manager was unprofessional and lacking in customer service skills. My advice if you come here is make sure to inspect your car before you leave.
