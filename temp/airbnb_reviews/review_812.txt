Do not go here for a massage. So loud and NOT relaxing. It is not only a spa but a salon. When i first went into the massage room, the calming music was really loud and I'm assuming it is in an effort to drowned out all the outside noise. The space is so small that you can hear everything happening in the entire place: hair stylists entire conversations, laughing, people constantly walking by the room and being very loud, hair dryers, the front door buzzer ringing every time someone walked in, etc... To add to the environment, the music changed to random comedy hour 3 different times during my massage. Poor Melissa my massage therapist did an amazing job and was so sweet...i cant imagine trying to do her job in this space - she should move because I would go to her all the time! Sadly, when I brought all this to the attention of the manager, she simply said she was sorry and that was it...surprised by her lack of awareness and poor customer service to rectify the situation. I am a teacher and rarely get to treat myself and was sad to leave with this experience.
