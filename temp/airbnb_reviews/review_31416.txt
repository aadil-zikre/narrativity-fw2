With it's long holes, most of which are relatively straight, this is a great course to come get in some wood work. Mix in some rolling alleys, a few water hazards (hence the name five ponds), and a couple tough dog legs, and you'll find this is a pretty challenging spot to do your weekend yard work. Probably got the club record with my 41 above par the other Saturday I came here (1:10 tee time with cart for $65), but I still had a great outing. 

As far as difficulty goes, I found the front nine to be the worst of it, because that's where most of the water hazards came into play (though I did have my only two splash downs of the day when I was on 17); utilizing the on location driving range with it's $5 baskets is a good way to work out that first hole rust, and should help keep your score down a little. Long greens will give you room to work on your putting, and there are also a few short holes where you can flaunt your skill wirh the irons. 

I suggest making your tee time because it can get pretty bumping here, and I doubt they'll hold your spot long. Sneaking beers on looked possible as long as you stay somewhat covert about it, but they also sell sixers at $12 each (during peak season they are $18). 

Five ponds is a great scenic course with a good atmosphere of professionalism; enough class to stand out from the more lax city courses, but also relaxed enough that you won't feel like too much of a tool when you shank your first tee shot.
