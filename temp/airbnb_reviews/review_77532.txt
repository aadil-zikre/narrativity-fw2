Personally I don't like used auto shops nor their repair shops because it's a scam in general to keep you coming back for repairs or paying more money for something. I happened to come with a friend.

I do like the massage chair located to your right when you walk in. It's pretty neat how they warn you about the house cats up front before you enter (there are 4 total).The employees were very kind as well. Just be aware if you are ALLERGIC TO CATS OR THEIR HAIR this place is not for you(there is cat hair EVERYWHERE). There is a vending machine to the left when you walk in right next to the cat tree.
