Marianne is extremely professional and has many years of experience, which translates into a great massage. I have worked with over 25 therapists in my life and I can honestly say that Marianne has the best technique, flow, and results. She is also down to earth and has a great sense of humor, which makes the experience even better. I totally recommend her and support the unique approach that she's taking with Ashiatsu, Deep Tissue, and therapeutic massage.
