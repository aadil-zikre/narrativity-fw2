Wow!   Just went to the brand new store and I was totally Impressed. 

Got a shampoo and a cut and the girls there really know what they are doing. I came home and my wife saw the cut and was really happy with the result. They had a great promo going on and the owners were there. We got to chatting and it seems like they have gone a long way towards making the store look and feel great. I'll be going back every couple of weeks now just to keep my hair looking good!
