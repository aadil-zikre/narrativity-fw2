Never thought I'd be reviewing a car dealership...but alas here I am.

I was greeted upon entering the sales room & that was the ONLY positive thing I can say about my visit. The sales member acted like I was bothering him the entire visit. Most of my questions were met with stern one word responses & he barely displayed any of the features on the car. Upon entering his office to talk more about the vehicle - he proceeds to clean out his file cabinet & barely made eye contact. Apparently this guy had something better to do than helping me purchase a car...so I left.  I mean heaven forbid I interrupt his very critical file reorganization. Oh and I can't forget the occasional condescending sweetie/sweetheart comments which were thrown in free of charge.

I'm not sure if this this interaction should be attributed to ageism, sexism, or a lack of people skills but I will say it was vile. I definitely expected more at a Mercedes dealership - what an absolute disappointment & embarrassment.
