First of all, I have to say that I eat out 3-4 days a week due to work and so I was in Indy and thought I would give this place a shot since I read the glowing review for Trevor.  

I walked in and the place was packed already at 530pm and so I was afraid I would have to wait a long time but the hostess was very nice and she asked me how many were in the party and I told her one.  She asked me if I wanted to be seated in the bar and I said no thank you and so she took me to this booth in the main dining area.

She handed me the menu and told me the server would be right over and in less than 2 minutes - she arrived at the table.  Now the funny thing that happened is that the table I was seating at had several ice cubes that were melting on the table and she walks up and says " was that like that when you sat down?"  and I said yes and she goes "wow I need to get that cleaned up but she never did at all.

Here is another funny part - I order a water to drink and she looks at me and stares for a second and goes "You know this is a brewery right?" I said yes but I dont care for beer and she goes well just in case you are a secret shopper I have to ask you that and went to get the water.

Due to time I didn't buy any appetizers so I ordered a salad and wanted to get a healthy dressing but she told me there was none available so I ordered honey mustard and the salad came out and the dressing was highly seasoned and not your ordinary dressing but it was ok.

I ordered a filet mignon and wanted it to be medium and it came out very close to well done and since I had to get back to the hotel for a call i decided not to bother and send it back.  The steak was very good - well seasoned so I had no complaints. 

Overall I would say that the food was good and probably would go back but they need to cook the food as it was requested.
