We've been waiting for an Ethiopian restaurant to come to Boise, and Kibrom's does not disappoint. Delicious authentic Ethiopian food. The Injera is amazing, as was the entire combination plate we had. We had red beef tids, chicken dora wat, cabbage/carrot/potato dish, yellow and black lentils and it was all delicious. Kibrom and the staff were warm, friendly, and helpful with the menu. Go try some awesome Ethiopian food.
