This place was really nice I have to say, I go out to restaurants just about every night and I really enjoyed it here. The only thing I didn't like was the parking-situation they've got going on, because finding parking was pretty hard but unless you know where the place is exactly, it's kind of hard to find. So I looked at the yelp reviews before going (and a lot of them recommended the Salmon dumplings) so I ordered them first with my date when we got there, they were amazing (they are actually lobster with salmon wrapped around them) but they are so good I would go back just for them. We also had the Stripped Bass Cargiaccio, which was also pretty good, and for desert we had the 'mochi' which are cute little rice balls with ice-cream in them, I had the vanilla and my date had the mango I believe, but we both loved everything, it was a good meal and I will definitely go back soon hopefully.
