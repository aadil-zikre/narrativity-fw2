I absolutely love Waffle House and go to different locations all the time with my fianc√©, we used to go to this particular location all the time and we really enjoyed it (there's even a picture of us on their board.) it's gotten to where when we go in no one greets us, it takes forever for them to come to our table, and when they do come to our table they're either rude, complaining about their day/their manager, or they're just really slow. They always seem to mess up our orders somehow by not giving us our waffles, bacon, or something as simple as some straws or not refilling our drinks when they're gone. I'm really disappointed about this because like I said, we used to go to this location ALL the time but they have definitely lost us as customers.
