I've been trying to stop off at the new Cafe Lift in Narberth for a while and today I finally did.

Cafe Lift is located in the old Royal Bank building and is right next to BMT Bank. It shares the same parking lot with BMT Bank, but there are plenty of spots.

When I came in, I was quickly seated in the back of the restaurant, which was surprisingly very large. I was seated with my party in a booth thy was fairly large, but it had a crammed feel due to the fact that another table was right next to us.

I went ahead and started off by ordering a small glass of orange juice. Although, I would assume Cafe aloft would serve fresh squeezed orange juice, it tasted as if it had been squeezed a couple of days ago. 

After contemplating what to get for breakfast, I decided to go with the cannoli French toast because it sounded very unique. It came out very fast and it was delicious looking as the pieces of French toast were hot and crispy and topped off with a cannoli ricotta filling. The French toast was nice and moist while the cannoli ricotta filling was a unique and tasty touch. The chocolate chip shavings along with some sliced bananas were also very good.

Altogether, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to to Cafe Lift, but if you are in the Narberth or Penn Valley area it is a good spot to get some breakfast!
