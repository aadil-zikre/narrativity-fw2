Interesting after reading these reviews I took my dog's there for a check-up and their bordetella. I had read the review of the guy who said his exam was free, so I went to their website and up popped a coupon for free examination for up to two pets on initial visit only. I printed it off and brought it with me, when I handed it to the office manager, he said this isn't ours but we can offer you a $25 discount. I requested a quote to find out how much the exams and the shots would be, IT NEVER HAPPENED! The doctor (who was a retired vet I am thinking in his 80's) came in and began the examination without letting me know what this would cost. When the assistant finally came back with the estimate for one of my dog's teeth cleaning (which was a joke, somewhere between $325 and up???) I asked her again how much this visit was going to cost, she said oh, let me look "$130 plus tax", are you freaking kidding me? I won't go back as I don't believe that anyone who talks bad about competitors is very ethical, especially when they were so deceptive in this offering of a  free visit only to charge me an OUTRAGEOUS amount without telling me in advance how much.
