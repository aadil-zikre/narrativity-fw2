Just left this terrible place.  I wouldn't recommend a dog to go to St. Mary's.  They ran test and told me everything was fine and that my heart might have a problem and he might have to admit me into the hospital.  Everything quickly changed when they found out I didn't have insurance.  The doctor didn't even come in to look at me, he said nothing about the swelling in my entire body.  I was however told to make an appointment to see "A DOCTOR for an heart sonogram..(something of that nature)  The so-called doctor also "LIED" and told me that my potassium was low and that he didn't want to give me a water pill.  But I requested it anyway since my entire body is swollen and I'm having problems walking.  When the rude nurse came in to discharge me, I asked her about my potassium and she told me it was fine. Even the nurse was nasty, and act as though she didn't want to be near me, talk to me, let alone answer any questions I wanted to ask.  I was basically left in the dark.  The only person that was friendly in this hospital was the registration guy, (John) 
They need to shut the entire ER department down....everyone from the doctors to the nurses suck big time.  I will never again visit this ER!  Nor will I recommend a dying dog to rely on the doctors/nurses/rude staff at St. Mary's.
