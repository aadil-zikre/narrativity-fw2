I went in for a bra fitting and was very pleased with the service I received.  I was measured in the dressing room and was surprised to learn I was wearing the wrong size bra!  While I stood there in shock my consultant brought back several different styles and colors in my correct size.  The consultant was so nice and made me feel comfortable, which was super since I was topless!  In the end I purchased 4 bras and the total came to just under $200, which I found to be very reasonable.  I definitely recommend this Nordstrom to anyone in need of a bra.
