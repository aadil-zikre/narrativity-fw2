This is one of my favorite places, my husband and I have eaten here many times over the last couple years, we've tried almost everything on the menu, we've brought friends, spent 2 new years eves, a couple birthdays, and even my in-laws 30th anniversary here. The family is wonderfully warm and sweet, if you come in a few times you'll feel like family. The crowd ranges from packed to empty, the service is usually good, sometimes the new waitstaff takes some breaking in however, and on busy nights it can be very slow going but the food is always amazing. Don't go in a hurry, use take-out when you don't have time to wait (although still allow about 20 minutes for that) but when you have time to sit down and enjoy a meal go, with friends and a couple bottles of wine and i promise if you are patient you will rewarded.
