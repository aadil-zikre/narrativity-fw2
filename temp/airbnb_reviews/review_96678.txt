OK.......I am going to try to break this down....

Call Ahead - apparently doesn't mean anything.
We did a call ahead about 45 minutes (we showed up on time) and when we go there, the hostess told us that our table "still wasn't ready" and said that it would be another 25-30 minutes. We wanted to get there for the early bird brunch special... thinking 30 minutes ahead would be plenty (not-including the call ahead time)

Hostess - apparently is a....(what is the word I am looking for)....MORON
We had been waiting now for about 40 minutes (not the 25-30 she stated) and she came out to call a table that obviously wasn't there, then told us that we could come in for that table, once we were all sitting, then told us that we couldn't have that table.

Meanwhile - there was a lovely 5 top table available
Yes you heard correctly, in the window for this (now 50 minute) ordeal, there was a table open in the FRONT window. So my husband went in and talked to the manager who then gave us the table that had been open the whole time.

Food - yeah it is beyond delicious! 
Is it worth going through ALL of that though....I don't know. It is too bad that all of that would get in the way of a good meal, but GEEZE! I had the Huevos Rancheros and oh man were they delicious, and the guacamole...all delicious! 

Summary....we missed the brunch special because they didn't have their junk together and we were all rather irritated that no matter how good the food was....it almost wasn't worth it. I hope that they get a new hostess who has the mostess. :)
