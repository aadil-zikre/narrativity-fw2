I had a really good experience with Precision Movers - we moved a 2 story, 3 BR house and it took exactly the amount of time I was quoted.  I felt the price was fair and the quality of service much better than a previous company I had used in the area (S&S moving).  The guys were good company and hard workers, and I can't imagine having done this move without their help.  There was a small accident with one of our items where it broke during the process of being moved, but the company has so far been very responsive to helping us get reimbursed for the damages.  I recommend them, especially after using the other company and it costing almost the same amount to get them to move 2 rooms in my house versus these guys moving everything!
