I've been going here for a while since its nearby..and they do the cream on the nails instead of the gel that changes color when you go in a tanning booth..
I hate going here in the summer since they don't seem to put the air conditioning on and always leave the door open..also, they always find sneeky ways to overcharge you..so whenever they tell me a "total" that doesn't match what the price board sayss, I just don't tip. They are very rude to you when you don't give a tip and will remember that in the future and give you bad service..

but otherwise my nails always come out decent.
