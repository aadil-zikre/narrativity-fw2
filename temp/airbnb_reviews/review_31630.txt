I have lived at peridot palms since January 2017 we signed a 15 month lease so we will be leaving in April 2018. When we took a tour we were wowed by the luxurious pool and two story gym and just the beautiful club house its self. I was very hopeful for the dog park because  I have a Italian greyhound puppy who needs the exercise, the dog park it self sold me on peridot palms. The park took a few weeks to open and was so wonderful in the beginning (February, March and even some of April) But after a few short months the dog park no longer looks the way it once did and as much as management keeps promising different upgrades to the park there have been NONE. We were told sometime in may I believe  that a shade solution would be going up. One of the residents who lived here put up a tent and it was stable it was tied to the fence and wasn't going anywhere, that was taken down by maintenance and when I brought up to Kari why they haven't put anything up even as a temporary solution I get nothing

On another note the safety of the community does not seem to be an issue to management, the gate that houses 6 of the 7 buildings is CONSTANTLY broken. I am not specifically blaming management for the broken gates but handling them in a more timely manor may make residents feel more at ease. Also the fire alarms have been pulled several times by whom we are assuming is or are residents, sometimes multiple times in one night. These are people who could potentially be your neighbors.
