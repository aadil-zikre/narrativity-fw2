In this podcast , we will look at DNA and what it 's made of so DNA is a polymer made up of two long strands small units that repeat throughout the structure of DNA. These are called nucleotides. So each nucleotide is made up of a sugar a phosphate and a base attached to the sugar. So you 've got three components. So there 's components of the phosphate the sugar which is Is a pentose sugar so you can imagine what Pentagon looks like and then also a base so the two long strands within each DNA molecule a held together by attractions between opposite basis. DNA there are four bases. And those are t a g and C which is thymine adenine guanine and cytosine. So each base has one other specific base with which it pairs. So T ads with a and g pairs of seem to be trying remember ta and GC. There 's the pairings and the sugar and the phosphates of the nucleotides form the long. hands So if you can remember what the parents are. So what base does G pair with in DNA? Have a think about that. Yes, the answer was C.
