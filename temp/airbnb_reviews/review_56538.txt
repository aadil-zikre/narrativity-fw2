I've had stellar service from the Autozone on Veteran's, so when my mechanic told me I needed Lucas Oil Stabilizer, I thought it'd be best to stick with this company and go to the one closer to my house. 

It may have been sheer luck or maybe this is a frequently asked for product, but before I could even ask for help, I found the bottle along the first wall of products (a miraculous first if you ask me when it comes to stores of this nature and my capacity for knowing where in the Waldo world to even start looking). Though I will say, I was offered help right when I walked in the door. 

One lady was in front of me buying a wheel and seat covers, but check out was swift, and I was on my way. I did notice that one of the attendants had come outside to help the lady put her covers on her car, and I thought that was very sweet. 

This is actually the second time I've been to this location, and I've never had any issues with check out lines or with MIA attendants so I could be lucky, coming in during off hours or this location has improved since some of these former reviews.
