Two summers ago, my husband surprised me with window boxes from Enliven for my birthday. It is truly the gift that keeps on giving! We have an annual subscription, so when the seasons change, Enliven comes out to remove old plants and refresh with brand new ones. 

I honestly couldn't choose which season is my favorite; the flowers and plants are always just so spot on! I really loved this year's spring planters with colorful pastel blooms and light green plants with big, fuzzy leaves. Summer planters require a lot of water; how I wish we had a hose in the front of our house! 

You might think the winter boxes would be somewhat dull, but they are anything but; they are always filled with gorgeous greenery and, my personal favorite, lots of eucalyptus. The scent hits me every time I pass them by and our home always looks so festive for the holiday season! 

These planters bring me joy every single day, and there's nothing like the surprise of a fresh batch when the seasons change. If you're thinking of upping your city garden game, I highly recommend Enliven!
