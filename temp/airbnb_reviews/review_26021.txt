Maybe the fact that this is the first time I've hired professional movers gives me a bit of a bias, but Simple Moves was AWESOME. They showed up right on time, and worked super quickly-pretty impressive considering they charge by the hour (and by 15 minute increments thereafter). I moved from a small-ish townhome, that I shared with a roommate, to a (much) smaller apartment on the third floor of a building about 2 miles away, and they were finished in under two hours. Not to mention they were very friendly and knowledgeable. The owner even stopped by to help me remove my flat screen from my wall mount that my decrepit ex-boyfriend had improperly installed! If I ever end up buying more furniture (heaven forbid), I'll probably hire them to haul it for me, just because it's so much easier and so cheap! Thanks, guys!
