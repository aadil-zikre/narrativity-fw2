Pre-pandemic, I would walk around the store and browse the aisles of wines, and chat a bit with the people who worked there. All of the people I interacted with are very knowledgeable about wine, and they were able to point me to some great bottles based on me telling them a few things about what I liked. I walked out of there with more wine than I should have the last time I visited, including a great Italian wine I had never had before.

Grapevine Cottage is still staffed with amazingly knowledgeable people and their aisles are still filled with wine, but at the moment, because of the pandemic, they are allowing you to browse their selection online, make your choices online, pay online, and then pick up your wine curbside. It's a pretty sweet deal, and although it doesn't have the same cache as going into the store in person, it's still great that you have the option to have someone hand you wine without having to leave your car.

I'm hoping they open to walk-in traffic soon! I liked being surrounded by great wine and wine lovers.
