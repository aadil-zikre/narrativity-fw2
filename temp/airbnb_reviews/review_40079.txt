I just got my haircut here today and I love both my haircut and the experience! I came in looking to trim down my pixie cut because the layers needed to be shorten. And even though I didn't have pictures for her to reference off from, Stephanie was able to cut my hair and made it look like how it did 10 weeks ago!  I love how light and healthy my hair feels now and would love to go back again!
