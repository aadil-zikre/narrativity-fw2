HORRIBLE customer service, from the moment I walked in. I tend to be pretty sympathetic toward people having a rough day, and I'm usually not one to complain about that kind of thing, but the lack of customer service of the front desk staff was ridiculous. The two women working there front desk put me second the entire time I was there. They acted burdened by my presence, and at one point one of the women literally said to another (without even looking at me or giving me any idea as to what the next step was...) "Should we just throw her at Steve? I don't know, everyone else is busy." I could go on with other demeaning remarks and negative body language that I received after trying to show my utmost kindness to them in return, but in a nutshell, it ended up frustrating me.
 
On top of that, I asked the man sitting across from me if he had been there before, and he said he had been coming back for the same issues for THREE months because they kept "finding new problems" and that he really recommended I go elsewhere, especially since my issue was just a big paint scrape and nothing that really damaged the car's functionality.

I took his advice.
