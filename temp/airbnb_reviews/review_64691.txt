I bought my 2001 Honda Civic from Mancini Motors after someone hit my first car and it was totaled. My boyfriend's family recommended Jami's dealership, and I am so glad that they did. Jeff was incredibly helpful each time I went back to test drive cars, answered all of my questions respectfully and honestly, and they were great with helping me set up financing for the first time. I never felt like I was being "talked down to" because I'm a woman in my twenties, which was common at other dealers.

I would absolutely recommend anyone buy their used car from Mancini Motors, especially if they need help understanding the financing process. I had a lot of questions, and Jeff and Jamie had all the answers. I was a wonderful car buying experience, and if I'm ever looking for another used car, I am not looking anywhere else.
