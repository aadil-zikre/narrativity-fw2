This Ford dealership is the only Ford dealership that I go to for my car repairs. I have always had good service when I went there and everyone is really nice and cares. Every time I go there they always go the extra mile to help me out. I recently just got my oil changed by them and they did it within 10 minutes. You cant really change it any faster than that and what makes them even better is they actually went out to find me to tell me my car was ready. Other dealerships would just park my car and wait for me to figure out my car was ready but they walked across the lot to find me and personally tell me my car was ready. Fully recommend this dealership for all your car needs.
