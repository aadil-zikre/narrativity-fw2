I went here for my first facial with Kristin.  She was wonderful!  I felt like she took so much time to analyze my skin issues and suggest a reasonable plan of action for me which made me so comfortable.  I will absolutely go back here because I felt so well taken care of and my skin really looks better because if it!  They run great specials, so be sure to ask the sweet lady on the phone about them.
