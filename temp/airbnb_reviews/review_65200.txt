Lovely florist off of Manchester Road with a great selection of bouquets, plants, and other decorative items for the home. The staff were friendly and helpful when I came in.  I didn't really have any price range in mind, I just wanted to find a bouquet that is beautiful and one of the ladies helped me pick one out and explained to me which flowers would last the longest.  The flowers are fresh, the arrangements are beautiful and they carry a wide variety, and they have the most adorable and creative vases! The bouquet I ended up buying came in a cool reusable jar container with a cover and a cute design.  

They have regular flowers as well as some orchids and the great thing is, you can go there and pick an arrangement without having to wait even on a holiday! I came in the day before Mother's Day and had no problem purchasing a nice bouquet. 

The prices are very reasonable and comparable to the other florists in the area. Another cool thing is, when you come in you are immediately greeted by some lovely scent of fresh flowers! I know where I will be going to the next time I need some flowers!
