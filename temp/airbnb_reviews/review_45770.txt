The worst stay of my life.... Dont be fooled very close to sesame place & very nice inside for a motel we thought we found a deal being Labor Day weekend 
 We chkd in @ 1pm & went straight to the park. We arrived back to the hotel @ 9pm & got ready for bed. My 2yr old son was sleeping in his own bed while me & my husband made plans for the 2nd day @ sesame place 
When i went to fix my son properly in his bed i noticed a bug upon further investigating their were about 6 beg bugs under my sons pillow we were horrified. We called the front desk & was told by Rhonda to bring them down in a tissue which we did she then told us she didnt have any more rooms. We were livid so say the least. Long story short the GM called the cops & had us removed from the property because we told another guest we found bed bugs in our room Im never going to stay @ another red roof inn again they will be hearing from my attorney & the health department
