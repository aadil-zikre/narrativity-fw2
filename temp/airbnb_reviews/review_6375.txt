PERFECT LOCATION! 

This place is affordable and you can walk to Canal st in about 7 minutes. So if you don't mind walking a bit to save some money this is your spot.

The hotel was newly renovated which usually I'm not too picky about but it truly makes you feel more comfortable when returning from a long day of exploring the city.

Also the breakfast was pretty good considering it is continental, can you say sausage gravy and biscuits, yum! 

My only negative which wasn't really a deal breaker was that the sliding barn door to the bathroom in our room was pitched wrong and once you closed it, it would slowly start to roll open lol (room 302) other than that, I couldn't be happier!
