It seems finding good doctors in Tucson is harder than finding a needle in a haystack.  I don't know about the other doctors in this group but Dr. Susan Courtney is a bit (rhymes with witchy), arrogant, condescending.  She makes you feel rushed, doesn't give you time to answer questions or explain symptoms thoroughly and she did what doctors call a doorway diagnosis.  After spending about three minutes with me she claimed she knew everything that was wrong (though several other doctors are baffled) and exactly what to do, and what medicines to take..even though (for me) they were contraindicated and got very uppity when I dared question her or indicate I might not be willing to follow her 'orders' to the letter.  I considered walking out midway through the visit and telling her clearly this isn't going to work out.  I have been to some bad doctors, thought it usually takes a little while to figure it out.. but she is one of the worst.  I just felt the bad vibe from the minute she entered the room.
