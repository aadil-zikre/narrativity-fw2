Welcome to Guitar Center, where it doesn't matter how much (or how little) you know, you will leave knowing one thing for sure, you got the best service damn near ever.  Or at least that was my experience.

I wish I had been more attentive to the names of all the people I spoke to here on the two visits it took to find the guitar I wanted.  Everyone was fantastic, informative, and eager to help this less than novice musician find a guitar.  

I walked in with literally no true knowledge of guitars.  I had a loaner from my father that I have been using to attempt to learn to play.  The loaner seemed difficult to play, and even when I knew I was hitting certain notes, they weren't registering, leading me to believe the guitar had a short somewhere.  My solution was to just go buy a guitar and give the loaner back to my dad.

On the first visit, I asked a lot of questions, and despite the store being full of people and closing sooner than later, everyone did their best to point me in the right direction.  The biggest piece of advise given was to come back when I had more time, sit, play around on a few, and find a guitar that "felt" right in my hands.  

On the second visit, I did just as advised.  I found a few guitars I liked, and when I had trouble narrowing the selection down to one, another employee named Kurt gave me the low down on sound quality and which features would be best for someone just starting out.  

In the end, I walked out with an inexpensive yet quality guitar.  I would highly recommend stopping in here if you are even curious about trying to learn to play.  If you already know how, then you probably already know that this is the place to go anyway!
