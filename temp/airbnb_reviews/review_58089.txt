The only time I get this pizza is when we're visiting down in Wilmington. I found it to have a great taste. The crust is a little thinnner than I like but the sauce has a good spicyness to it, and they don't go overboard with the cheese. 
My kids seem to like their sandwiches, too, but their pizza is really the reason to go.
