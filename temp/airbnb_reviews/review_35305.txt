This was by far the Best, BEST, best dentist experience I've ever, like EvEr had. So informative and comfortable, no detrimental issues like my worst nightmares of my imagination was leading me to believe. I think of Little Shop of Horrors anytime i think dentist. But no, I highly recommend and encourage y'all to make Dr. Bishara your go to dental professional. His efficient and kind team care for you, the calm atmosphere makes for a stress free visit, and the informative step by step process of intake, X-ray, exam and cleaning makes for a very well executed and enlightening service. They have a true passion for maintaining oral health, so if you've been stalling like i was, there's no question Bay Premiere Dentistry is the one to go to, so make an appointment today. Your mouth will thank you.
