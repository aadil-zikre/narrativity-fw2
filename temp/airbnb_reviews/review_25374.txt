My friends had class with them and had a great experience, maybe they were pretty good back then. When it's my tern thing got bad. 
AVOID THIS DRIVING SCHOOL IF YOU CAN 
They're fraud and even illegal. 
The first time I took the road test, their car insurance was expired, they didn't even noticed. 
Today when I went to the dmv, the examiner looked at the car and found out there's a black tape on the car. She peeled off the tape and found out the engine lights and the airbags lights were on. She then told me I cannot take my test in that vehicle because the car shouldn't even be on the road. As you can see on the picture, both lights are on, and on the right of the lights you can see a tape residues. I was so mad that I talked to the office, they told me "it's your luck and have nothing to do with us". If the car was fine, why did anyone put tape on it? You can tape the light, but you cannot cover the horrible condition of the car. Think about it, you're using that car to teach STUDENT DRIVERS. With bad engines and broken airbags, you're putting your customers' life in danger, especially those who's still learning how to drive. 
Using a bad car to provide profitable driving services is not even legal. 
Also they admitted themselves that other student used that car to take the test and it's just this time they got caught, and they're blaming me for this. I didn't cover my fault by putting a tape on. I didn't just ignore serious and potentially deadly car problems and let students use the car, I'm lucky that I don't have to take my test with a faulty car.
