Avon Florist did the flowers for my daughter's wedding this past weekend.  We worked with the owner and she helped guide us  in making the decisions needed to have beautiful flowers at a reasonable cost. About 2 hours before the wedding we discovered that we had not ordered enough corsages for the Grammas and they put two more together just in time.  The bridal bouquet and the arrangments that hung on the entry lights were especially lovely.
