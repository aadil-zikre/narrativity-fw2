I haven't been to the Muttart Conservatory since my brother got married; he got his pictures done in each of the pyramids.  The pictures turned out great and that was because of the beautiful flowers and plant life that can found in each of the four pyramids.  I'm sure you're thinking, "If you've seen it once, you've seen it before," but I find it a great place to take a date and walk around.  Curtis and I went there a little while ago.  The two of us walking around in these exotic environments; it was like being on vacation without actually leaving the city.  
Every Sunday, I think until December 20th, the Muttart Conservatory puts on live Christmas music and there are crafts and activities for the little ones to do.  Hearing the live music really put me in the mood for the big day.  I'm not really into Christmas but my heart kind of melted after listening to the festive music. 

Admission for adults runs at $9.75, which is pretty good for a get-away vacation.

Like I mentioned before, if you have a weeding you should totally take your pictures there.  If you know anyone who is new in town or who is visiting they would love to see this play.  I took a family friend here a while ago and he really had a good time taking pictures and posing in front of these exotic plants; it was a fun day for him.
