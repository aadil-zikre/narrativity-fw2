Worst experience ever from the office staff not returning calls to the manager of the office. So glad I had made an appointment for a second opinion because I was misdiagnosed to have surgery to remove a cyst on my ovary. If you want a place that will answer the phone and a doctor that understands then you should go to Womans Care Florida and not this joke of a practice. Do yourself a favor and don't go to this incompetent office.
