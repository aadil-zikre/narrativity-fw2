Our recent stay at the Franciscan Inn was less than ideal. My boyfriend and I checked into our room in the late afternoon, dropped off our bags and went out to explore Santa Barbara. When we returned to our room that evening to get ready for bed I noticed a bug crawling on one of the pillowcases. I killed it, but as I started removing more pillows and turning down the comforter I continued to see more bugs (roughly a dozen) - crawling on the sheets, pillows, etc. so disgusting. I called the front desk and let them know the situation. They offered to move us to another room, which we did, and promised a discount on our stay as well for the inconvenience. While the staff was very courteous (hence why I'm giving them 2 stars versus 1), we unfortunately still have not received any refund for the stay. I would not stay near again due to the questionable cleaning procedures, and would warm others not to stay here again. It's hard enough to travel and worry about Covid, you don't need to add bed bugs to the equation!
