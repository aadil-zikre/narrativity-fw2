So if you are at all interested in the history of transportation, from the horseless carriage to the train, then the Museum of Transportation might be pretty interesting for you to check out. There are some very interesting things to see here, I found the different kinds of trains that they had sitting about that had been restored to their former glory to be rather interesting.

Walking around I can see how many small kids would get a kick out of the place. I'm sure that if I had grown up in St. Louis I would have wanted to come here as often as possible to play around and climb up on the trains.
