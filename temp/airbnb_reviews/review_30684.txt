I picked up from this restaurant twice in the past. I will admit that this is the best Chinese food in the area. I decided to order chicken and broccoli last night. I picked it up, brought it home and began to eat it. I noticed a black piece in my food, I pushed it aside on my pate to notice that it looked like a bug. I moved it around a little and I was correct. I thought to myself, Okay it's nice out maybe they left the kitchen door open and one bug made its way in. I took a closer look at my plate and noticed more black dots, and upon further examination there were bugs throughout my entire dish. I wanted to get a closer look to make sure 100% that these were bugs and not just a little piece of broccoli. I put the bugs under a microscope to confirm and I was disgusted. I immediately disposed of the food. I will never order from here again. I can understand one bug, but lots of them throughout my entire dish is another thing.
