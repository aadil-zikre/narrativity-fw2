Union stations is open, The Station is back up and it's in full effect.

The ferris wheel is open and a few of the restaurants are open also, where you can dine inside or outside.  On nice days, dinning outside after being inside, is beautiful.

Most people are following social distancing at least in the restaurants and on the ferris wheel.

I believe it'll be a pretty safe bet to do either of those are both, you can come down to Union Station and see the aquarium it's open also. 

I didnot go by the aquarium as it's appointment only from what I understand and I was just out and about and came by Union Station getting out of the house.

Parking is still good and it appears they have done a little updating to the parking lot, there is plenty of parking spaces.

I like to see a few more attractions here, as I miss the movie theatre, I probably would have took in a movie, but I know at the present time with this pandemic that is probably not a good idea.

Nonetheless, I say come on down and get you a meal and enjoy the outside scene, they got the music playing and you can enjoy the ferris wheel and if you get a chance go by the aquarium. Just enjoy your day, it is just something to do.
