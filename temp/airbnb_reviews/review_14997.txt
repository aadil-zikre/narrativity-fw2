Went to the lot to look at a few different vehicles with my husband. When we first pulled in there was a car parked by the office, half blocking the way in. Once we got around the car there was nowhere to park by the office so we parked between two cars of their cars on the lot. We look back to see two people just sitting in the car that had made it difficult to get in and just thought how weird. There were people on the lot moving cars from one spot to another and not one acknowledged us. We walked the lot to find the cars we were interested in and saw another car pull i n and park behind the car that had caused us problems, completely blocking the entrance. The guy in the new car got out and just stood by the car. 

Having enough o the weird vibes we decided we didn't want to buy from these people and went back to car. Only now our car had been blocked in by other cars. There was no way for us to leave. So my husband went into the office to find someone and stated the entire office had an awful odor. and the girl behind the desk ignored him. He could hear someone in the back of the house screaming about how he's had to bring a car back 3 times and it still wasn't working. It took a bit but he was finally able to get a kid that reeked of marijuana to move some of the cars. Apparently the car that was right behind us was the customer in the backs car. The boy opened the van and commented about being lucky the keys were inside and moved the van. Except he moved the van into the only way for us to get out of the lot. My husband had to yell at the kid again to move the van AGAIN just so we could get out. 

It was the absolute worst place I've ever been and I refuse to go back!!!
