And so just tell him that you 're there check on him and he 's gon na it 's gon na come out of it , but it 's going to take time. I 'm depression is harder. It 's so it 's just people just feel I mean , I just feel like there 's a lot of Darkness around him. He 's so sad and so just when you have someone in your life like that just really just telling them that you 're there and checking on them and then if they eat No , I 'm hoping that he can seek some guidance some help. I feel like he needs to get help. So yeah. All right , Dwayne. Hopefully that 's some that 'll help you but I understand how that that dark place can affect your relationships with other people. So I would n't take it too personally Dwayne but at the same time just let him know you 're there for him. And you know when he finds himself , I 'm sure he 'll reach out to you. Thanks for the phone call. We appreciate it
