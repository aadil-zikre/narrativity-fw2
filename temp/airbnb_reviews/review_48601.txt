These people are great:  truly knowledgeable, kind, efficient, and thoughtful in their approach to sick animals.  The doctors and veterinary technicians are all extremely careful and tender with the animals, and generous with their explanations and advice.  They exercise great judgment in triaging, always putting a true emergency ahead of an urgent-care problem.  (We've never had to wait more than 20 minutes on any of our visits, but if we ever do have to wait significantly longer, we'll appreciate that a needier animal is getting attention first.)  Keystone's round-the-clock availability has changed our lives by giving us a safety net  when our dog or cats get sick after regular hours (which, of course, is when they always get sick).  After a visit the staff automatically faxes its report to our regular vet, who has been pleased with the care.  The charges at Keystone are like what we're used to paying for regular care (but ask ahead and they'll give you an idea of what to expect).  Bottom line:  this is a trustworthy place with smart, dedicated, friendly people who are there when you need them.
