I 'm worried. I 'm very concerned about this game because you guys did n't pick that up already. It 's it 's bad man. We 're counting on Chris Hogan and Phil Dorset and like maybe Gronk has some kind of play off juice left in them. And maybe they gave him all the steroids in the fucking northern and southern and western and hamsters comes with all the hemispherical man all of them. I do n't know man when he 's just trying to reverse. To get Tom Brady is not the issue. Okay , not the issue you have he 's not the issue. You 're not the issue. It 's team. I 'm afraid he 's great. Tom Brady 's great and when they get him actual players next season will be awesome for you to see the future BP fine
