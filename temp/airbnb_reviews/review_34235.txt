Friendly staff and a very nice visit overall -- No one likes to pay for unexpected accidents, but if you have to, this was worth it IMO. Dr. Kalivoda was great and made time explain everything thoroughly. I'd gladly bring Hamilton, my Italian Greyhound, back the next time he decides to take a dive off the couch.
