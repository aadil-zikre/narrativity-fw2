I am an not an cyclist, hiker, rock climber, etc.  But looking at the well-used bulletin board here, with ads for used gear and sporting opportunities, and the extensive selection of bikes and outdoor gear, it is no wonder this is a magnet for people who take these things seriously,  For myself, like a lot of people, this is a go-to place for good flip-flops.  Also, their casual shirts and khakis in the front of the store are pretty cool --I got a great button-up short-sleeved shirt here today for just $30 (though most of their clothes are Patagonia or similar brands and are more expensive).
