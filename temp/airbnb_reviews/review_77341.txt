Murph's is exactly what it is and it's the best of it's kind.  There is no pretention of a diverse collection of rare microbrews or promise of a PC menu for picky eaters, and people dont generally go seeking these things there, they are in for a miller lite or something stiffer and some barfood, but mostly the company.  The patrons range from Doctors to Students to Contractors and they all get along swimmingly. Billy keeps disposable cameras behind the bar to take photos of his favorite patrons and rotates the photos on the walls, he rings his bell when someone special comes in or he feels like giving a free round, and the Burger ala Billy is top notch in my opinon.  Billy also has a deep love for area high school athletes as he has a few kids who had nice careers and has a ton of particularly catholic league paraphenalia around the bar,    He's created an atmostphere that people have been loyal to for decades and they stop in for a drink even when they are no where near east falls.  It is truly a Philadelphia Institution and a coveted destination to those who know it and I highly reccomend a visit to see for yourself!
