I've been very skeptical of going to eyebrow waxers and threaders after a brutal job done at a nail salon in high school, so I've always taken on the task of shaping my eyebrows myself. However, after deciding to let them grow out more, I was nervous to touch them because I didn't want to undo all my hard work and they looked too different in shape to even know where to start. Dina immediately set me at ease and kept me informed throughout the appointment by letting me know exactly what hairs she was removing, which she was leaving, and why. Dina did an amazing job and I walked out feeling like I didn't even need to fill them in (which I rarely leave the house without doing). Dina instructing me on how to maintain them and how long I can expect the results to last before having to clean them up myself and before having to go in for another appointment. I would highly recommend!
