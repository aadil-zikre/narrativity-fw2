I don't buy too many physical books now but it's still nice to take a look and this is a great place to buy gifts! Even when they're packed they seem to know how to deal with it well and keep everything moving. 

We easily found everything we needed (and a couple extras) and despite the packed store and long lines, they had all the cashiers open and we were still in and out pretty quick. 

No complaints about this store, and I'd come in again!
