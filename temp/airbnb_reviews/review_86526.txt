While visiting Clearwater beach you see these Florida free rides all up and down the strip. So we were down on the strip celebrating and decided to use this free ride service we having been hearing. Do after calling the number our ride showed up within 5 mins. The driver was very kool and full of information about all the attractions and great places to eat at. So after our ride I asked how much this was. He's like it's free if you feel like giving a tip that would be great.  Well I gave the guy a tip and it's definitely cheaper than anything else on the island for a taxi!!!  Highly recommend you use this service if needed it's cheap!!!
