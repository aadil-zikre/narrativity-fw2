Now, not to be 'that person' but Laurel's is definitely a flower shop that caters to women!  I am not saying men won't love the personalized service, staff that truly knows their business, the amazing selection or the attention they will get from the person for whom they are purchasing flowers but ladies will love the flowers, love the gifts... this store is truly a hidden gem.
It is shops like this that prove that locally owned businesses can provide quality products, remarkable service and still offer a very competitive price.
If you are looking to be remembered for your gift - flower or other - choose Laurel's on Whyte.
