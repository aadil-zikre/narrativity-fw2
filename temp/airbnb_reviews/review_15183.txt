When I had a problem with my rim I took it there because they advertise to fix bent rims, the man who spoke to me said "No matter the condition we will be able to fix the rim." I left pep boys of Woodbury to bring my service to First Choice. Needless to say three days later the same tire went flat. The rim was fixed so poorly  and ended up damaging my new tire from pep boys that pep boys gave me the replacement tire FREE OF CHARGE! How nice! First Choice said they would send my rim out to be fixed for another $130.00 charge taking no blame for my rim leaking again. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me! I ended up going to Ed Constante Tires, who also after seeing the rim and felt bad for my situation and gave me a new rim for under $275. I hope everyone learns from this and does not have to get introduced to First Choice Tires idea of honesty and customer service.  I have left out the numerous phone c alls and confrontations with the owner because what I wrote above is enough to tell you to bring your service issues elsewhere!
