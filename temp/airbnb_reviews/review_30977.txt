Nice jewelry store.  Very nice selection.  Bought my wife an engagement ring from another location, but we bought our wedding bands here.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  They're great about cleanings and resizings.  Prices are so so, but their credit cards and financing programs are great.  And hey, you can say "I went to Jared!"
