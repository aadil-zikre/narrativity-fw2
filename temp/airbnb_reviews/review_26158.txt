Palo Verde cleaner is about 3.5 star in my book, but I feel like rounding up today ;)
Heads up: CASH CASH CASH only!

Super small family business! I like supporting local businesses so that's why I picked this spot when I needed my white coat cleaned. As a medical student, a clean coat is one of the most important first impressions so I wanted to start off the year fresh. 

Cons:
-because it is family owned, a young girl took my coat in and quoted me $10 because she wasn't sure how much it was supposed to cost. When I came back to pick up, the owner (I presume) fixed the price to $8
-a little bit more expensive than what I'm used to. The coat was a very simple white soft coat, about waist length so I didn't expect it to have cost $$$
-I came by to pick up on Monday (as I was told when I dropped it off), but the coat wasn't ready, I came back again Tuesday, still wasn't ready. I had to come back Wednesday to pick up a coat that was dropped off the previous Friday... luckily I didn't need it urgently. 

Pros:
-so after some pick-up misunderstanding, I thought I would call it quit with this cleaner... UNTIL I saw my white coat, all pressed and whiter than when I received it brand new a year ago. All the coffee stains, pen marks, wrinkles (I know, I'm pretty clumsy) were all GONE! All my frustration went away! They did an amazing job and I was so stoked to put on the coat for clinic the next day.

Thanks Palo Verde... I'll be back when I feel like a baller and need more items dry- cleaned.
