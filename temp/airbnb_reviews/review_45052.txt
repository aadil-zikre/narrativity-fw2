If I could give negative stars, I would. 

I went to Tuffys for an oil change, I called and made an appointment, because I was told It would be certain that I would be seen at that time. My appointment was at 11am, and I didn't not leave until 12:45. The hour and 45 minute experience was the worst I've ever has to deal with. I could see my car from their waiting room, and for the first 30 minutes they didn't even attempt to change my oil. After an hour of waiting, they finally called me into the back to tell me all the things wrong with my car. Not only was the guy treating me like an idiot, but he was also calling me "Beth" I corrected him twice, my name is Elizabeth, and he replied with "well I'm going to call you Beth" very annoying. My uncle is a mechanic and my car is new and well kept, but apparently, I needed over $1000 in repairs, and failed to mention my bad breaks that I was already aware of. I told him I just needed my oil changed, and it was frustrating being here for over an hour. It was only then when I returned to the waiting room, that I saw them finally changing my oil. I decided to write this review, because when I went in for my next oil change (obviously at a different business) they told me my oil filter, which I paid extra for at Tuffys, was not replaced during my last oil change, but just washed off to make it seem as if it was new. I will never go here ever again and I will make sure to tell everyone I know that this "family" business is run by crooks who are rude, time wasting, and cut corners to save money.
