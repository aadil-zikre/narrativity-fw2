As a former barista, I am picky about coffee, particularly about espresso shots. I love to be able to watch a barista prepare a drink, and one of the first times I went I saw this: the first shot of espresso prepared for my drink wasn't up to par, and the barista quietly dumped it out and drew a nice second shot in it's place. That act told me what I needed to know - this place cares about good coffee.
  I have recently been able to frequent the Purple Bean and have been pleased with the atmosphere, love the friendly baristas who make you want to hang out there, and impressed with the coffee drinks. I confess I don't drink the flavored lattes and mochas most people enjoy, but I do appreciate great espresso. 
  It also makes me feel better because this is a local business, and I happily pass up the closer Starbucks to patronize the Purple Bean.
