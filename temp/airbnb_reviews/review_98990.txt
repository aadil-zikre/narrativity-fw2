Trip over themselves to be helpful some days; roll their eyes at you when you walk in on others.

The first time i went in there they were super helpful and informative.  They led me to a product i liked and talked me through flavors of e-juice.

The next time I went in, they seemed impatient that I didn't already know what I wanted.

Third time I went in, I upgraded to a minibox.  They put it together for me and filled it for me.

The next time I went in, the minibox was leaking and I got a mumbled "probably your o rings".  nobody even looked at it.

One more round with them and they happily replaced the coil to try and fix the leak - and then let me know - for the first time - that if i needed to swap it out, i needed the receipt I'd thrown away 13 days earlier.

And then all but called me a liar when i told them that it hadn't been mentioned to me before.

So i'm vaping on an expensive piece of junk until i go buy my next one... somewhere else.
