I've been renting in the Nashville area since 2013 and had quite a few ups and downs in terms of property managers. I moved to the hermitage area and ended up renting with team Wilson this past year and overall had a really great experience. The property manager David has been super helpful. We rented a house that like most inNashville area it was a bit older so came into its own series of small problems. (Had a pipe freeze this winter was the main issue) and David was quick to get someone out to resolve the issue. We like where we are staying so don't have any plans on leaving the current rental for awhile mostly because we appreciate good management.
