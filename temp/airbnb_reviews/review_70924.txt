We have been frequenting the Red Lion for over 20 years, and The manager/ bartender, Jonny is half the reason for that. During our recent visit, however, we learned the new owners had let him go. Also, things are missing from the menu, and I've noticed some price hikes. 
Letting go of a loyal employee of 20+ years and the face of the Lion is a big mistake. We may have hung around through the changes if the staff was still there, but now it's just not with it.
