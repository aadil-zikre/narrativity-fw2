This is probably my new favorite lunch spot! I had pre looked up their menu before I arrived and let's just say I was already drooling over a lot of the options, when I arrived to this location I couldn't believe how big it was on the inside and I liked the dining area it seems a little more fancier than a traditional fast-food spot. I had decided to do the choose 2 option I got the Spud Ole a baked potato which is just a traditional baked potato topped with chilli, cheese, and jalapenos, it was really good probably could have used some sour cream though and my second choice was the turkey melt sandwich I believe I think I'm butchering that name but it was on like Panini bread and it was a hot turkey sandwich and it had bacon on it too it was really good as well I love how thinly slice of turkey was now my only complaint was I felt that the portions were a little smaller than they could have been because when I saw how huge the portions were for an original price item I think they could like meet somewhere in the middle on that. I finished and it wasn't like I was hungry when I left but I wasn't full either I still could have probably had a little more and the drink that I got was a really nice size and they refilled it for me they brought my food to the table it was just an overall great experience I will definitely be choosing McAlister's for my lunch more often there's a few other items I'm interested in trying like the baked potatoe soup, the salads, there's just so many options that I have to try.
