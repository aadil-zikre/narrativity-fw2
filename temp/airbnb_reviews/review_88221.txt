from this day on, we have ound the perfect person to care for our 4 pets when we go away. i have used every other form of care (vet boarding, kennel etc) and Charlie was by far, miles above everyone else. we went to see my son graduate and were gone for a week. knowing what excellant care my 2 cats and 2 dogs received, in my home, was such a huge weight off my mind. i have never felt that kind of peace of mind, when away fro home for an extended period, leaving the pets behind. Charlie cared for my 2 obnoxious dogs, one who is terrified of the world and the other who thinks hes the worlds guard dog, and my 2 cats, one elderly and the other on a daily med( pills). it was the first time that ive ever gone away and not once thought of my animals. i wasnt feeling bad because i knew they felt safe at home and werent afraid in a strange place or cage or kennel., oh and a side bonus, this was the most reasonable priced of all services. i would definatly use Charlie again. What a nice person. Thank you so much
