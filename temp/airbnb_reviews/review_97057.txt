Minus 5 stars would be more like it.. have not been to this buffet for quite some time.. we went just before dinner crowd should have arrived to find a empty place.. we went in despite our worry.  Again, should have listened to my inner voice yelling DON"T GO IN!  Food - disgusting, desserts - disgusting, the best tasting thing in the place was the soy sauce.. which is kept in large containers at serving areas with no cup to take some to your table should you want to dip your so called sushi in... then listening to I guess the owner/boss reaming an employee for wanting to leave early right up front, yelling and degrading the employee.. well, guess we had live entertainment if you can call it that.. then the real shocker.. the BILL.. $30 for this poor excuse for food.. more like a $30 crap bill.. I had a hard time not saying anything (my husband did not want me to) or leaving behind my thoughts on a napkin.. for obvious reasons they had no customer comment cards.. NEVER AGAiN.. we usually go to China Grill in Exton, this place made them look really good.. so much for buffet.  we ended up here due to Max & Erma's being closed down...   won't make that mistake again.. geez, i'd rather cook at home and clean up the mess than spend money at this place.. do yourself a favor.. don't even think about going in.. probably would have had better food at Chucky Cheese and fewer germs!
