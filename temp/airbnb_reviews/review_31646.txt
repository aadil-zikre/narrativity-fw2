Just a note, did not try the food or bar attached to the rink so this is strictly having to do with the skating.

Steinberg is a nice place to visit, although maybe only sparingly. The decoration is very festive, there's nice lighting and plenty of Christmas trees, there's a big fire to warm yourself and visit at. It's a nice place to hang out and do something that you can only do in winter.

It could get a tad expensive, especially if you make more than a couple trips and have to rent skates, but I think you should expect that. It's also really not bad for a couple of trips per winter.

The only negatives I can really find are things that go hand in hand. First comes the crowd. It's a winter tradition here, and I'm sure some days are better than others, but at times there was hardly any open ice to skate. And be careful that you don't fall/skate into someone who has fallen, lots of skate blades around fingers! 
The second negative, most likely because of the crowd, is the ice got really torn up. They use the Zamboni to clear the ice every so often, but it only helps for about one lap and the ruts and holes start coming back out.

It's a fun place to go. Obviously the negatives aren't that bad, but good to know. Would definitely go back here.
