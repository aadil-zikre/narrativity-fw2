Everything tasted great! 

We got the chicken and waffle taco (the tortilla was a flat sweet waffle!)

Nashville hot tofu taco (the tofu was so crispy and sauces were flavorful!) 

Spicy tikka chicken taco -  this was okay. I wish we got the picnic chicken taco instead. 

Elote - so delicious and flavorful!
