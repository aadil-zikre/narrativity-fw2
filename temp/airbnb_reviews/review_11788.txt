This review is for the (corporate) customer service and overall value. The pod itself was as expected and the people delivering on both ends were friendly and normal and one guy even declined a tip saying it was not allowed. 
My problem with Pods is they seem to be inherently dishonest about pricing and delivery. I was quoted a price then once the pod was in their warehouse the price changed in their favor, saying the price I was quoted expired (within a week of it being quoted, which the person who took the order never mentioned) and then delivery took 2 weeks longer than promised (they blamed peak moving season, once again never mentioned at the time of scheduling) and that meant sleeping on the floor with 2 kids for 2 weeks. Then they screwed even that delivery date up & when I demanded compensation after several weeks someone in the Florida office offered $50 (what a joke, we gave these guys several thousand dollars) but the real kicker is before they give you the $50. you must sign a document saying you will not give a poor review on yelp or other outlets. I declined the $50 and plan to warn everyone about this company. I heard they are owned by the Koch brothers which makes me sick I used them to begin with.
