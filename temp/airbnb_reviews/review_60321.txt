Went here a few weeks ago for a fundraiser...

Cheap tickets!  Cheap beer (for a ballpark) and not a bad seat in the house!

Actually really pretty along the river too, and the parking was well-monitored so I didn't feel like my car would be stolen while inside the ballpark.

I think it'd be fun to come back here, rent out a party room, and have as much fun watching a crummy minor league team as a watching the Phils!  (since I don't really watch the game...I mostly drink and talk with friends anyways...)

Great for families, great for kids, all in all a good time and I'm sure we'll go back.
