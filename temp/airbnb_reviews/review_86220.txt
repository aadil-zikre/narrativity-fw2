Expanded menu... better rating.

Bab bowls are good, and if you want to know about them, read my previous review. It's a virtual Bab tell all! This one is dedicated to everything on the menu here that ISN'T a bab bowl though, so if you're not interested, tune out now. 

The Downtown location had a menu filled with options outside of the bowls, but when South Reno opened, they weren't there. It was a conscious decision to make sure the location was ready to handle the expanded menu, and in retrospect, it was a good one. 

I still order a Classic Bab every time I go in BUT these days I'm more interested in the giant chicken wings they serve. I've ordered them twice and just can't get enough. They come out super hot, fresh, and crispy, and the sweet/spicy and garlic mayo sauces (all served on the side) are amazing for dipping. Next time I'm going to get them breaded because Korean Fried Chicken, the original KFC, is incredible and I have had the breading here before and it bumps these wings up to the next level. 

On my last visit I also noticed that they were adding some new protein options to the menu including fried chicken (covered in that sweet spicy sauce), fried beef, and a few others! 

The fact they're changing the menu is exciting. It means we get to enjoy more Korean food, and that makes me SO HAPPY!
