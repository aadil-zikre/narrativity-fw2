This was my first time coming here. I like the feel of the diner. The day I went it was quiet and I liked the atmosphere. I ordered a chicken salad on a croissant. To be honest the sandwich was mediocre it didn't really taste like anything and I definitely had better at other diners so that's why I gave a three star. 

But I wouldn't say I won't come back. I always like to try a few different items to see how I like it. My daughter had a grilled chicken Cesar salad that didn't come with croutons for some reason and she said it was okay,
Nothing special but you know it's lettuce so who knows lol. 

We are Going to try it for breakfast and dinner items and when I do I will be back to adjust my stars.  

Overall the diner was nice, clean and staff seemed nice and also seemed like they had people who are recurring guests so that's a plus. I'll keep you posted on my returning visits !
