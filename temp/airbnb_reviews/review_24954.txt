In a matter of 15 hours I am completely frustrated with this dealership/management and refuse to do business with them in the future. Upon arriving my wife and I sat and waited with no service for at least 15 minutes (no one even addressed us or said hello)

My wife and I were asked to sign for a deposit of $500 to begin the process of looking for a lease car of her choice that was not on the lot at 7PM last night (she signed the agreement without me there and did not understand the details of what she was signing). The sales rep said it was going to take 4-5 days to find a car. The credit report was not run yet, no car had been identified and they did not have her social security number. In the morning we had a conscious change in heart because she found the car she wanted which was in stock at another dealership where the service of the staff was honest and solutions oriented. Bottom line we did not want proceed with Piazza.

Between the time of signing the contract the night before and the early morning of the following day, they had no vehicle identified and the deposit was not even processed yet. The sales Representative said that the deposit was already processed which was obviously a lie (which I confirmed with the bank) and forcefully communicated that since we signed the contract there was no way to amend the agreement and they would keep our $500. I then was passed on to the manager for a continued debate. The defensive conversation made me feel forced into a purchase I did not want.

If anyone is considering to buy a car from Piazza Honda of Pottstown I recommend you look elsewhere to avoid the stressful and frustrating experience we had to go through.
