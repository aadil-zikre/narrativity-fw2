Woofies is the closest thing you'll get to a Chicago dog in St. Louis. They're delicious and the fries are very Chicago as well - greasy and a little soggy - that's a good thing, trust me. FYI - they only accept cash - at least as of they last time I went there - so don't make the mistake of ordering sans cash. 

If you do, you'll be forced to deal with the fact that the smells from your delicious bag of food have permeated your car as soon as you pull up to the window, but you can't have your food b/c you didn't heed my warning and BRING CASH. So, as a result, your food is just sitting, sitting at Woofies waiting for you to pick it up, but you have to run to the nearest atm (that doesn't charge a fee - I think they offer atm service, but it charges) to get cash while your food just sits, lonely and cooling waiting for your return.

Basically, if you're craving a Chicago dog or, if you've never had one and want to know what a real hot dog is supposed to taste like, go to Woofies. Just bring some cash with you.
