My first visit to the office, everything was great. A quick and easy process, Dr. Roman reviewed my medical records, talked with me about my conditions and current treatment plan, and was able to get me registered with the state quite easily.

However, a year later, when I went for a follow-up appointment and to renew my patient certification, it was a totally different story. During my visit, everything seemed completely fine- we had a consultation, and I left assuming that my certification would be easily renewed. It has now been over a month since my follow-up appointment and I am still not registered with the state of PA. I've called Dr. Roman's office multiple times, but their phone system has been down for weeks and you cannot speak to a human being on the phone. Since I'm a chronic pain/neuropathy patient who is disabled, and now without the medicine I depend on to control my symptoms, it's difficult to get to the office - especially being located in an area like Old City which has limited parking and requires lots of walking... Not ideal for disabled patients!

I've emailed both the practice and Dr. Roman directly, facebook messaged/posted, and tweeted- basically every form of outreach to get someone to help me or at least give me an answer as to why this is happening, and I've received nothing but radio silence! 

Dr. Roman's office had no problem taking my money and sending me on my way, then ignoring every attempt I made to contact them. If MMJ is a major component of your treatment plan, avoid this place like the plague! They will leave you hanging with no access to your medicine and no concern for your well-being.
