Well where do I start! Brought my car over there for a Groupon, Oil change just over 2 months ago. Also had a tire rotation as well. Come to today to get a recall fixed at the local Subaru dealer. Getting the oil changed I find out the oil plug was stripped. They had trouble getting off and had to replace. Ok, just figured the amount of changes I've had that this is expected. Next they go to rotate my tires!! Find a lug nut missing!! As well as most of my tire stems stripped and needing to be replaced in order to rotate the tires!! Really!!!!!!!! Then when I was at Car Revolution and they tell me I needed brake pads replaced.......I asked the Subaru dealer to check those for safety concerns.....I get told the brakes are fine!! No change needed. Well I will now let you judge!! Don't go here if they have the original service manager they had when I went!! Hoping he is gone!! Not even going to bother to try and get a refund.....because the Jack A): told me he would email me a receipt!! What a joke don't go here!! Hoping this review helps and saves a lot of unwanted repairs.
