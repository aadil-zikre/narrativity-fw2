A staple gas station in the Midwest, I love the rewards program and it's on of the main reasons I'm such a frequent shopper. Speedways are all over the place and this one is located on 82nd street. I decided to stop here before I was getting an oil change at the Meineke.
Given it was the morning of carb day it was very packed, but I knowing that going in I had no issue waiting to get some gas.
I also went inside to grab some a drink and a snack, this store location was great! Very clean, which you can never expect anywhere you go but it's always nice when it happens.
All the shelf's were well stocked with options, and the hot food stations had a lot of choices.
The check out line was long but thankfully the clerks kept the line moving which I appreciate as a customer. Will be a continuous repeat customer at speedway!
