Yesterday we were passing through and decided to stop by this spot my mom recommended we try! After browsing through their extensive menu, I decided on the Mango Blackberry Chicken Salad and an Unsweetened Ice Tea with Lemon. Lemme tell you, this was not your average salad, the price point is decent and filled with fancy ingredients! One bite sends you, I had never tried mango on a salad so I was curious and with the blackberries and tangy balsamic vinaigrette and all the fancy Ingredients of this large salad, caramelized pecans, bleu cheese, my taste buds went on a flavor ride! The chicken was also grilled to perfection and I was left very satisfied with my meal! The Ice Tea by my surprise came in a nice large glass, with a fresh slice of lemon and the herbs were very flavorful on their own! No need to sweeten it! 

My toddler chose the Chicken Tenders and I asked for a side of fruit for her in place of fries, since it was a healthier option and otherwise she wouldn't eat her meal. She loved it and I couldn't help but  smile at the name of the kid's menu which came with a variety of unopened crayons she enjoyed coloring with, "Little Big Foot Menu" Cute right?! 

This was my first dine-in since quarantine and the staff were very welcoming, mentioned to check out the statue inside, which is life-sized, my toddler thought the Sasquatch was real until we assured her it was safe to approach! They followed the guidelines: seating was nicely spaced out, our server was masked up and our food came out in a timely manner in time for our drive! I would highly recommend paying a visit to this well-known spot! I know I'll definitely be visiting again to try more off their menu and take another pick with our Sasquatch friend! I know he isn't "big foot", but he reminds me of one of my favorite family movies Harry and the Hendersons with his big broad smile and significant size! Support small, especially when they need our business the most, Happy Memorial Day!
