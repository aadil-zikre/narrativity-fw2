Had my car towed because I had to leave it in a lot. Something was wrong with my car. When I called to find out if my car had been towed the guy who answered the phone was a complete asshole! Not only was he rude from the moment I inquired but then proceeds to tell me I can't puck my car up until the next morning because he already left for the day at 4pm. Must be nice to have bankers hours....on top of all that he was rude to my husband when he called and is charging $325 for my car. When i tried to explain that there was something wrong with the car he was rude and said he watched me get i to another car....does he not find it odd that someone would park one car and get into another?  If he was watching me why didnt he ask if i needed help? This guy is only in it for the money! I will never use him and I will tell everyone about my horrible experience.
