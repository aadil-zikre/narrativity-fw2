I was shopping for a BMW for my medical school graduation gift and went to several BMW dealerships in New Jersey including BMW of Cherry Hill and Turnersville and right before settling on a car, my best friend told me to check out BMW of the Main Line. I drove almost an hour to get there and it was absolutely worth it because they gave me the best deal all around. I just drove home my 2012 328i today and I couldn't be happier. KC was very helpful and informative throughout the whole process and stayed in touch with me until my car arrived from overseas. He also helped set me up with a car insurance broker and made sure all the paperwork was done on time. Overall, I highly recommend BMW of the Main Line to anyone who is looking for a great deal, exceptional service, and an amazing experience.
