It literally kills me to write this review because I wanted to love this place so so so much. 
NEVER until I moved to New Orleans did I have to specifically specify that when I schedule a Pink & White Fill that the Pink AND the White be filled/corrected. Unfortunately, the shop I used to go to no longer has someone that can do acrylics, so I have to shop around for a new place. I would much rather a place just tell me they don't have anyone that can correctly do something than get my hopes up and walk out with crazy looking nails. 
I should have known when the nail tech asked if I wanted a soak-off to get up and run because that is always a telltale sign that they don't know how to do Pink & White without starting a whole new set. I will say it is partially my fault for not stopping her once I realized she wasn't going to touch the white part of my nail, BUT that wasn't until she was buffing and putting the gel coat on them. I've been to nail techs that start with the pink and end with the white and visa versa, so I didn't recognize she was "finished" until she was practically done.
I understand that this is a very difficult style to do, but I also expect nail techs to not allow their customers to walk out with hands looking like this...
In the meantime, I'll likely just paint over it until I can find a new place.
