Let me start out saying just the fact that this trail exist says a lot about the area's commitment to providing the community with another outdoorsy venue to enjoy in a variety of ways. To find this type of path in an urban environment is pretty amazing, of course there are aspects of this trail that leaves a little to be desired but those that complain about the shortfalls need to appreciate the investment even with its imperfections. I'm impressed with the number of over-passes over the busier intersections and the vast bridges that span the sections of water along the trail, yes it's true the trail crosses less busy roads and you need to pay attention but most of those have flashing lights and give the pedestrians and bicyclists the right a way over the vehicular traffic.

I rode about 28 miles of the trail counting doubling back to my starting point, the pavement and grassy easements are pretty well maintained, there was a mowing crew out along one of the sections I rode showing the commitment to make the experience as good as it can be. I did ride across sections that were absent of shade but I also experienced beautiful water crossings and plenty of opportunity to stop and take a break in the shade.

This is definitely an urban trail so take that into consideration when you plan your day - some offer up tips on places to snack and eat and that's a plus but personally I used this trail more as an escape so I carried my own refreshments and snacks. I encountered quite a number of people during my ride and found everyone was respectful when there were interactions. I also noticed that there was practically no litter showing the respect people have for the environment or maybe showing the efficiency of the crew tasked with caring for the trail, but I hope its more about people respecting the environment.

I find it very difficult to publish negative information on a space that allows anyone to get out and enjoying our beautiful state without paying a fee - it's not perfect, but it does exist so if you're able to explore it and are able to accept it for what it is consider yourself the lucky one...
