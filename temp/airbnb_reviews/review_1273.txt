Went to Bistro 44 for dinner with a few friends. We felt welcomed the minute we walked in, we were greeted by a hostess, Seated right away. we were approached by a server as soon as we sat. I was surprised because the place seemed very busy. Our server was excellent, took a drink order, told us the specials and made a few suggestions for us. being our first time there we all tried something different. No disappointments here!! Service and food were excellent and we will be back.
