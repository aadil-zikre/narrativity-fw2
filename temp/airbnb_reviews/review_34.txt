I do n't go I do n't do it and this includes friends birthdays a My personal friends know that well , Jessica 's probably not going to come it 's not that I do n't love them. It 's not that I do n't care. I do. Wish I could but the same time I ask myself is this environment going to be good for me ? Personally , I do n't drink anymore. I I 'm very careful on what I put in my body after fighting my cancer for the past year. I 've learned a lot. What about health and truly keeping toxins away from myself ? And so yeah , it 's kind of very uncomfortable for me to be around people that are wasted and everyone 's like take a drink take a shot have a drink. Come on. You can just do one drink come on , and I just do n't want to put myself into that environment and feel that pressure and have to keep telling them. No. No , I 'm good. I 'm good
