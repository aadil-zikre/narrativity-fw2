Yep..you cant beat the price.......the service on the other hand, well that is totally beatable.  The Hot & Ready wasn't hot OR ready, and the storefront was not even busy with customers when I went inside. The girl that took my order spoke so fast I couldn't understand WTH she was saying, and therefore had to ask her to repeat herself more than once. The unfortunate staff in the back looked like several Little Caesars running about with their heads cut off..this way and that, questioning tickets, it was almost comical, except for the being hungry and having to wait too long part. 

Another lady that had called in an order ahead of time and arrived while I was waiting had to wait beyond her expected time frame and, if this is any indication, she wished me luck in waiting on my order.  I have not had this problem at the Little Caesars on McCarran/Prater.  Good luck if you go to this one on Pyramid!
