food was extremely bland, bland steak, wasn't cooked properly, the staff/cooks we're swearing a lot, everyone there was dressed to impress and makes them seem pretentious.. not a good atmosphere, I almost went and joined all those young studs in the bar area.. sitting around.. trying to impress the youngin's ... guaranteed they all went home alone.. in their expensive cars... and cried.. nice popped collar.. kiddo.  (seems like a trendy spot for the oblivious)  New York Steak w/peppercorn brandy sauce = extremely bland.. raw tuna was presented in a neat way.  (only good thing to say about my experiences there..)  My Ladies Smoked Salmon was dry and ... flavorless... and who the hell wants their steak to show up in front of them with a teepee of veggies and mashed potates and a sprig of basil or something sticking out of the freaking steak.. absolutely dumb..
