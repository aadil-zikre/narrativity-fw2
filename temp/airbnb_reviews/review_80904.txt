I am so grateful that we have Swift Urgent Clinic in Northern Nevada! It is an excellent walk-in clinic that exists outside of any of the hospitals in our area, which generally leads to more affordable treatment of injuries. Concerned about a strain, sprain, tear or closed fracture (one that doesn't break the skin)? Swift is the place to go! Because they are still a newer practice, it's pretty easy and well, swift, to get in and quickly be treated by an Advanced Care Practitioner. 

My husband injured himself at work some months ago, and I referred him to Swift due to the excellent word-of-mouth I have heard from many of my colleagues in the healthcare community. He was able to get in, have x-rays taken, meet with a Physician's Assistant for results and a treatment plan, and walk out with an orthopedic support device as well as a referral for an MRI all on his lunch break! The Providers and staff here are caring, compassionate, efficient and very knowledgeable about what they do. He was also provided a referral to an excellent Orthopedic Surgeon from Great Basin Orthopaedics to follow up with after his MRI.

I cannot recommend Swift Urgent Clinic enough for all of your Ortho, Sports, and Spine ailments/injuries. They can even help treat new onset joint pain, too! Three cheers for Swift!
