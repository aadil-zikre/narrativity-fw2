I've passed The Sample Rack countless times while driving down Pine Street. There are always gorgeous dresses in the window and they rotate constantly. I called to book an appointment and spoke with Carlene, who explained the unique nature of the shop (samples only; designer dresses offered at a discount, etc.). 

The shop is open by appointment only and you receive the undivided attention of the staff. Carlene and her colleague (whose name I forget -Â she was so sweet!) pulled a really lovely array of dresses according to my preferences. I tried on an incredible gown that was discounted by several thousand dollars. It wasn't quite what I was looking for but I'm sure the woman who purchases said gown will be absolutely thrilled with the find.  

Leading up to my appointment, I booked an appointment at another store just to get an idea of the styles that I would like. I wasn't expecting to find something that I loved at the first store, but that's exactly what happened. I kept an open mind for my appointment at The Sample Rack, and even found a couple strong contenders for runner-up, but ultimately decided on the dress at the first store. I called Carlene after I made up my mind to let her know and she was so sweet and genuinely happy that I had found my dress. I wouldn't hesitate to send a friend to The Sample Rack and will continue to sing their praises!
