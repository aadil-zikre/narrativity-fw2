I have had three great experiences with Plymouth Auto & Tire. I tend to wait until the last minute with my car, and they have been great about working me in for last minute inspections and repairs (my car is not new or under warranty). When my car needed several repairs (repairs that other shops have told me about, so I knew they were justified) they broke them down into simple "this needs fixed immediately or you're going to have serious problems soon" and "this can wait until you can afford the repair" terms. Bonus-the loaner car was really helpful for my last stop...a Saturday.
