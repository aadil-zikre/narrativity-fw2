Came here when on vacation with my boyfriend. Museums are my boyfriends thing, but its always a plus to learn something new I haven't learned before, so this museum was pretty cool. 

There is so much history within the walls of the museum and every exhibit is so well put together and catches your eyes. 

You cant beat this museum because it is free to get in, which is always a good thing. We walked through the museum for about 3 hours just taking our time and making sure not to miss anything. 

I liked learning about all things Tennessee and about the presidents from the state, I also enjoyed learning about slavery as well.
