I think both teams played really fast pressure the puck really , well Connor Clift and also had a really good game tonight in my opinion. I think he was really good at defending Zone entries from Tampa Bay and not allowing them to have too many chances on the rush when he was on the ice and also kind of defending the slot as well. It was n't as bad of a game as it feels right now obviously feels awful blowing a 4-2 lead in the third period but I 'm looking forward to if they beat the Maple Leafs in the first round of the playoffs , you know , seeing a rematch in the second round of the playoffs , you know , Clifton 's playing the game. I wish more HR recalls played he 's not playing like he 's an age I recall just there temporarily know. Not trying to rock the boat too much. He 's playing like he knows that they 're relying on him to play at the NHL level and he 's doing so he 's being aggressive. He 's taking risks calculated risk that are paying off. He 's not being too damaging to his team. I wish more players who came up played with the confidence that he 's been playing with his lovely. Yeah , I thought Clifton had a great game to he the confidence kind of got him in a little bit of trouble. I feel like Bruce kind of pulled back on the reins a little bit and kept Clifton the shifts a little shorter. I think he gave him isolated incidents where he was able to have an impact on the game one that I think that he that they probably would have liked to get him off the ice a little sooner , but that I think listed played really well
