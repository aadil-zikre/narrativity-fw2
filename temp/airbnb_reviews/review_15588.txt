It's so funny to me that I was born in Tucson and grew up here until I was almost 10yrs old and always saw "A" Mountain, but never made the trek up to the namesake until returning over 20yrs later...life is interesting that way I guess!

"A" Mountain (aka Sentinel Peak) has a pretty rich history (there are plaques in both english and spanish explaining the peak's importance and even where Tucson got its name). The drive up gives you pretty great panoramic views of Tucson, especially downtown. But warning, for some reason people drive up here like bats outta hell...I don't know why you would go over 25mph on the road up here when there are so many things to see on the drive up...but people are idiots and feel the need to race up the mountain. I had to pull over a couple of times to let said idiots pass me so I could enjoy my jaunt up to the top.

You can park in front of the "A" itself and even attempt to climb it (though make sure you have closed toed, sturdy shoes because it is steep and there is broken glass everywhere!). But, if you make it up to the top of the "A", the photo opp is pretty epic! 

I will say that I went in late afternoon on a weekday (and maybe it was because of Spring Break), but among the local and out-of-state tourists, there is a certain "element" here that is blaring music, smoking blunts, and leaving trash, broken beer/alcohol bottles and cigarette butts everywhere. That just makes me sad that people cannot respect this place for themselves or for others...

That being said, it was a fun little Tucsonian experience that was very nostalgic for me and would recommend if you are driving through Tucson to make the detour. I was there for just under 45mins and most of that time was climbing up and climbing down the "A" portion of the mountain.
