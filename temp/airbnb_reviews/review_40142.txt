I really wanted like this car wash, because it was right on my way home from work. But I have used other automated car washes in Tucson and found them to be much better. While it does an adequate job of getting your car cleaned I found it it never really rinsed off the soap, didn't dry the vehicle well and has an odd turn out at the end of the wash. If you have a larger vehicle like a truck you can't easily exit the car wash, it requires a turn, backing up once and then leaving. The area to vacuum your vehicles isn't covered so you're exposed to the hot sun or elements while cleaning your vehicle after the wash. I also found that the vacuums were not very powerful, they would pick up loose dirt but if you need deep cleaning they won't do the job. The area surrounding the car wash is extremely busy, it's located right off of I-10 next to a Circle K.So once you exit the car wash one of the only exits is through the Circle K which is extremely crowded. So for me this car wash will do in a pinch but it's not one I will visit frequently.
