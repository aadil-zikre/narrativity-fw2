I stayed here recently cause it was within stumble & stagger distance from all the bars I planned to hit on the UYE: Metry Bar Crawl...I pulled in to get my room while the sun was still up & immediately began having 2nd thoughts about my choice....but I left my gun in the truck and went in to get my room key anyway...

Booked thru Expedia and there was an issue with my reservation...not sure if it was Expedia or the motel regardless this kinda issue was a first for me using Expedia...got it worked out and headed off to my room...the parking lot was damn near full and it was mainly weekly tenants of the road construction and blue collar persuasion....now I come from that background but even to me this place looked sketch...again I had the gun debate and again decided to leave it in the truck....as I made my way to my room on the 2d level I enjoyed a wonderful contact high of some nice smelling hemp as I came outa the open air stairwell to the 2d level...plus I was offered a cold beer....turned it down cause it was Coors Light & didn't want to compromise my palate and ruin booze drinking experience that was to come...

Made it to my non-smoking room but seriously after that experience was I expecting it to not smell like smoke? No I wasn't & therefore I wasn't surprised when it smelled like a full ashtray....On leaving to head out to the 1st bar on the Crawl I again enjoyed a a delicious contact high....

Look I was basically renting a pillow for 6 hours so I got what I paid for at a low price...if you're looking for a place to base out of to do touristy things in Jefferson & Orleans Parish you can do better...if you're looking for a cheap room in an outa the way place so you can let your freak flag fly with Mr. or Mrs. Right Now without fear of getting busted then this would definitely be a place to check out....
