The only time that I go here is when they have the coupons for the free little lotions, which I think is the best way to go and shop at Bath & Body Works for people that have no money, because they can get a really nice thing that will last, and look around a really nice store for all kinds of things that they might want and put things on lists so that friends and family can possibly get those things for them. I love the people that work there because they are so helpful and they are so into what they sell there, no matter where a person is, they know just about everything there is that there is in there store. I went there to get a 2oz. bottle of their latest scent, and one of the employees offered me a sample of country chic cashmere lotion, and it was the best thing that I had ever felt or smelled.
