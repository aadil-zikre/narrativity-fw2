My wife and I went looking for a replacement vehicle as ours was wrecked and we knew the general type and make we were look for when we arrived. Myke and Dan were our 2 salesmen and they walked us thru the process very professionally and we left feeling like we made a great purchase. I decided a couple days later to trade in our other car and went back and spoke again to Myke Price who knew the type of car I was looking for as I had test driven a couple makes when I was there with my wife. He and the staff went out of their way to make my requests and budgets work and I again left feeling like the car I purchased was what I wanted. I would recommend anyone to go to Andy Mohr Kia and work with Myke Price. I also appreciated the finance gentleman who just gave us the facts and numbers as they were and let us make the final decision with no pressure. Thank you Andy Morh Kia and team!
