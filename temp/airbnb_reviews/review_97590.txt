The nurses and doctors may be great, but they will continue to lose patients if the front end of the process remains as it is. 

Yes, I delivered my child through the staff here and they were wonderful at that time, but it is the appointment setting process which has remained a deterrent for me to return as a patient.

I literally came straight from the hospital after my discharge to here as my follow-up. I was not well enough to drive and had a cabbie bring from the hospital and this was explained to them over the phone prior to my arrival. However, it wasn't until I arrived that they told me the cost. With my insurance I cannot fathom how it still cost so much but I felt I should have been informed prior to my arrival, especially when I provided all my insurance info by phone and was coming straight there from the hospital via a cab driver.
