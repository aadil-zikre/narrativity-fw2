Taking my car here was the worst experience in my life as far as car repairs go, I took it in to have a front in fixed, I will be fair and say the front end was beautifully done, but my car went in the shop with windows, and left with the window out of the back of my four and a half year old convertible top, argued with management who first told me that a heat booth melted it out, I asked if they had vandels on site, they told me no, actually they said  in the end , after 6 days of attempting to repair the window only to find out they would have to buy the entire top, then it became defective glue, saying that,my insurance company wouldn't pay for it. Be very careful about going here, at first they accepted responsibility for the damage until they realize it would probably be over a thousand to replace the top alone, the dealer quoted them 2200. That's when it became defective glue. In entirety they kept my car 7 days after the damage was discovered. If they truly felt they weren't responsible why did they keep it 7 days. This is not as large a community as they think, and word travels fast, so be careful, very unprofessional
