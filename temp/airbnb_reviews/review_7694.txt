In one visit, Western Exterminators managed to not just treat my house for our ant problem, but discover where the nest was and wipe it out. They said wait 7-10 days? Try 7-10 HOURS before the ants stopped showing up. Worth every penny, and the company rep was friendly, professional, and came across as an all around great guy. He took the time to explain what was going on, and wiped out an ant infestation that has been annoying us for years. We've hired other companies to come out and try and deal with the ant problem, and not one of them ever tried to find the nest - they just treated the inside of the house. 

I highly recommend Western, so much so that I signed up for a contract with them to make sure our ants don't come back!
