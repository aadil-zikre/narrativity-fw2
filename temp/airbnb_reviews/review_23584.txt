Don't let your kids go here, everybody is petitioning the Ranch but this place is worse. I've picked my daughter up from Beercade a few times over the past 2 years and there's always drunk girl fights outside, which, unfortunately is normal, but my daughter has seen them kick drunk girls out physically because they are too drunk and they throw them in the street alone. My daughter is done with the bar scene but last night they went out for Saint Patrick's Day and her friend drank too much and she was struggling to stand against the bar, my daughter kept asking them for water then she saw 2 huge guys manhandling her out of the bar, she was not resisting and she's 120 pounds soaking wet, they threw her out on the street in a t- shirt all alone. My daughter ran out after her and called me but there was another girl with them who stayed. Your kids think they know who their friends are but when alcohol is involved, everything changes. She couldn't walk and she never drinks, which is why she was so sloppy; if my daughter had not seen this happening and ran out behind her, who knows what would have happened. When I picked them up there were kids that were really wasted and rowdy going in and out, why weren't they kicked out. Here's a picture from a video (it wouldn't let me post the video but she's unconscious and drunk guys are cheering) from last year, we don't know this girl but my daughter couldn't believe they let this girl get to this point. Pick your kids up if they're going. Nobody else is looking out for them.
