I don't usually write reviews on franchise places such as this, but seeing that i've been here a bunch of times and still see zero review, I had to write a little something about it. This is your standard McDonald's. Its clean, has inside seating, no outside seating, no playhouse, two drive-in's, and on the corner of a busy intersection. I usually come here if I'm feeling way to lazy to cook and just want something fast. Most of the time ill use their drive-through and idk if its just when we go, but it always seems busy. Regardless of that the line usually goes pretty fast. The people who work here seem pretty patient and nice, never got one of those mean fast food people here yet...maybe I should try and push there buttons. JK. 
Anyways, all in all its fast, easy and tasty (fast food standards).
