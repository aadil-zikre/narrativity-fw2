I've eaten at quite a number of grill places, but this locally owned non-chain is without doubt one of the best! Our waitress, Cindy, was wonderfully helpful and nice; we had to send her away two times just so we could have enough time to look over every mouthwatering item on the menu! Everything we ordered came out perfect, and the flavors were definitely unique, and the prices very reasonable. If I'm in Indianapolis, this is the one grill & restaurant I'll definitely come back to in the future.
