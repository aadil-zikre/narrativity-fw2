So I do n't think you know , maybe you throw them in the boat that I do n't know what to do with them , but I do n't think that I do n't think the money matters if it 's really time to compete. I do n't think Mike will go back to the want to try and come back this year their clothes which is going to be so that it begins a year just because I know how he is and I can see him in September. Oh absolutely and he 's ahead of schedule. He 's been ahead of schedule this entire time. So I do n't know that would be would that be a shot in the arm will not be something else. But yeah , this team is there not far people are always are clamoring about Gerrit Cole. And this and that and you know , hopefully we do n't need Gary Cole. Yeah , I know that 's that 's the such a stupid thing to say , but hopefully we do n't need Gerrit Cole , you know , if all goes well this team is not going to need a Gerrit Cole , you know , it 'll be nice to have one to to put them over the hump but they wo n't need a Gerrit Cole like the Cubs need a job less well , and that 's that 's an interesting. It 's an interesting take I like it because you do see a ton of talent in this in this rebuild all homegrown. You can you can legitimately fill out a roster of players that could be on the twenty. Twenty-One twenty-two twenty-two starting lineup for the White Sox without acquiring anybody but do you actually really believe in your heart of hearts that this team is n't going to need a major free agent signing to get into a deep playoff run. Well think about it
