I've heard a lot about this Union Jack's pizza biz, so when given the opportunity to try it, I was all aboard that train! 

We went for the deep dish meat pizza and let me tell you...this may be sliding right up to my favorite pizza place in Indy...no joke people, this place has got it goin on! Our server was training someone, which sometimes can slow things down, but this crew was on their game because not only were they super helpful and quick to get our order in and out to us, they were super friendly and incredibly knowledgeable about that menu!

Can't wait to come in and get another 'za!
