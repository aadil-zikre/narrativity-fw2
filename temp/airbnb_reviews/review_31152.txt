Honestly, it's a shame that we don't have a better yarn shop on the NW side. LYS are supposed to be friendly and inviting, but the customer service at this place is sorely lacking. Usually it seems to be that the staff are extremely friendly to... their friends, and anyone who buys a ton of overpriced yarn. As I usually come in to get one or two skeins, I'm not in their clique by any means. Would be nice to have a reasonable room temperature in there - as they also charge for water, it seems nasty to keep the shop so hot. 
I hate going there and will only do so when I can't get what I need anywhere else. As soon as I walk in, there's a chill if the owners/staff don't know you, like you walked into their living room. Not a great way to run a business.
