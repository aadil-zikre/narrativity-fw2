I previously gave these folks three stars, as while their customer service wasn't stellar, they appeared to know what they were doing.

Why the sudden downgrade?  Well, it's a bit of a story.

The reason we were there in the first place is because our car's engine started vibrating, and (of course) we were in town on a Sunday and had nowhere else to go. 

They determined that one of the cylinders wasn't firing, and changed our spark plugs (which needed doing, but didn't turn out to be the cause of the problem).  Since the actual cause was a proprietary part that needed replacing (the coil pack) and the dealership was closed, they couldn't do much else for us.

We took the car home and later to Dan, our regular mechanic in Sierra Vista, whose skill and honesty I've never had reason not to trust.  He replaced the broken coil pack and all seemed to be well for a while.

Fast forward a week or two, and the engine starts idling rough, and occasionally hesitating mid-acceleration.  We take it in, and our mechanic says that the coil for the next cylinder appears to be failing, and orders a replacement.  Sure enough, the cylinder stops firing all together on the way home.

After the replacement comes in two days later and we take the car in yet again, I come back to find Dan looking puzzled.  He shows me the old ignition cylinder boot, which is very obviously broken (and just as obviously was once glued back together).  His best guess was that the people who put the spark plugs in broke it, and rather than tell us and offer to replace it, simply tried to repair it and hoped no one noticed.  

Very unprofessional behavior.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
