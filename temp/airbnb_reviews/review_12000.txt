Having stepped up my running game in both frequency and distance, I knew I needed the right shoes. Preventing injury, or at least attempting to avoid it, was probably my biggest reason for going to a running shop. The $15 coupon they put in their Broad Street Run blog was probably the determining factor for going to Philadelphia Runner. 

When I arrived to the Manayunk location was I pleasantly greeted by Neil and his associate. The customer service was top notch. Neil took his time to properly fit me, which included watching my gait on a treadmill and really listening to questions/needs. For each shoe I tried, I was able to give it a whirl on the treadmill, with and without insoles. 

The whole process took at least a half hour, probably based on all of my concerns and wanting to be thorough with my selection. I ultimately decided on the ugliest pair of sneakers that were probably the most expensive shoes I've ever purchased. Approximately 14 miles to date, I'm not doubting my decision and would recommend Philadelphia Runner to anyone. I feel like I'm running on a cloud and my feet have never felt so supported. 

Neil was also so kind as to recommend a few local races and helped resolve the doubts I had about my training. I've been to other Philadelphia Runner locations for group runs and follow them on social media; they are very active in the Philly running community. 

Thanks Philadelphia Runner for your help to the finish line.
