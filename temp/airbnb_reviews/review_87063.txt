Unless your car is under warranty, avoid at all costs.  Every time I would go, I would end up with a massive bill, and you have this sick feeling in your stomach that you're being taken advantage of.  The showroom is beautiful and the salespeople are slick, so up front you have a great feeling about getting the 7-Series you always dreamed of, till you end up paying 2,000 for a routine brake change and oil.
