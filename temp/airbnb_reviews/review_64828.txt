Just finished up moving my things and love my place. Although I can't stand moving, everyone at the office made the move so easy and I am thrilled with my place. They even gave me a move in gift with some fun snacks when we were moving in the heat. 
Haven't been here long but so far, I am so excited and appreciative. Looking forward to the year ahead and the property.
