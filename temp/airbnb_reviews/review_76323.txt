Totally not what I expected!  It's bigger inside than it appears and is a pretty cool venue for being in the Ameristar.  We went to see "That 80's Band" whom put on a GREAT concert!  

The service is good and the waitress took pretty good care of us considering how busy it was.  The dance floor is not huge but it works for the size of the venue.  If you're not a dancer, there are plenty of good seats around the stage that you are able to still see the band perform on stage.
