I was passing by and I saw the samples, so I decided to try the roasted almond tea( it tasted just like a warm almond cookie ) delicious. I asked the girl if they sell a cup and she said " I guess I can make you one, but I would be 6 dollars) I told her that was fine. She left for a while then came back and said, why don't you get the 20 dollar bag and "I'll  make you the cup of tea for free "  , I told her thank you but I just wanted the cup of tea. She looked disappointed and told me" it is just 20 Dollars" and I said thank you so much I just want the cup of tea, if you don't sell the cup of tea, it's ok.She said "I'm making it, but why don't you get the bag for 20" maybe it was me by I felt pushed and terrible because she was annoyed, but I just though this was like the other tea place or coffee shops.At the end she gave me a red tea that taste like cherry nothing like the toasted almond but I left because I was so over the whole thing. The sample tea was delicious but not the one she made for me, but I will not go back.
