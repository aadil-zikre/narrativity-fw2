I was there at 9 pm with my son because he got stomach flu, front staff call us right away and I was inside within 5 minutes, medical assistant was nice and did my son's vital signs and send us to exam room, we waited for more than half hour, finally doctor came and assessed my son, she first said that she can't do much because it's a viral and then my son throw up in there, so she said she will give him zofran for nausea, and write a prescription to take home, I said OK fine and she gave to him. Now comes the exiting part, am between jobs and my insurance from new job didn't kick in another month, so I have to pay cash. When I went to front desk they said $125, I asked them what are extra $16 for, guess what they said for one zofran pill they gave to my son, are you kidding me, it's a highway robbery. I told them nobody told me that one tiny pill was going to cost me $16, before charging or robbing someone at least tell them if they agree to that, but I don't think they care much about people, they care about $$$. I will never go back there again, if anyone still want to go make sure you check out how much they are going to charge you for any additional service even a small pill..
