I love her and he's proud. Love Rockets too. They're my favorite NBA team. Ya know like is just so fun and probably it 's with the Lakers. I 've always just been a fan of the Lakers just because I like the clothes they were the closest. Like I just like watching them when they go back to good player. I 've been a fan of them since they were back in Minnesota just because they were the closest and be a team but then they moved to Los Angeles. Like what was that like seven years ago ? I 'm sure I do n't know either. I do n't know much about basketball. Wait the Lakers. Yeah , they used to be in Minnesota. No. Its soda because it 's always been Los Angeles. I do n't think so
