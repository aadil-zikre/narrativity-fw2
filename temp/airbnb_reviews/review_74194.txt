When I used to work out in the suburbs, I stumbled upon Pennsylvania Tire & Auto when I was looking into oil fill discounts on Groupon. It's been almost three years now and although I live and work in the city, I am happy to make the trip to the suburbs for Pennsylvania Tire & Auto's fair pricing and phenomenal service.

I have come here for regular oil changes and inspections... and if there is ever anything funny going on with my car. Matt is always friendly and explains what's going on with my car in a way that I (someone who is not a car expert and often calls my dad for help translating) can understand. I wait for my car to be finished so I've spent a lot of time hanging out with Matt and the guys over the years. They're all kind and honest, even when they make fun of the fact that I'm typically the "problem child" with something new and different wrong with my car. In the cases when there have been issues with my car, Matt is able to help me find an affordable and safe solution.

When my car was in need of new brakes, Matt told me exactly how long I could go before needing to get them done and provided me with a fair estimate. I called on a Monday and scheduled an appointment for Friday morning. I was in and out in less than the hour wait time I was quoted.

I am so glad I found this spot and I will not take my car to anyone else!
