This review is geared towards the dance club section referenced by anna marie c. There are a couple tables and loungey sofas around the edge of the floor and the DJs have played requests for us in the past. Mirrors line the walls, probably to make it feel bigger, but useful for checking out the room to dodge creepy guys dancing out of your field of view. D'angelo's feels pretty under the radar, which I don't mind b/c it means there's a little more space on the smallish dance floor. We find there are usually some small groups and couples on the floor (no bachelorette parties here), but enough elbow room to feel comfortable and to run away from people we don't want to dance with.
