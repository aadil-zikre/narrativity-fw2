I was so sad when the "Ritz-Carlton's" Club Level was already sold out.  So...I took a chance & decided to stay at the "Windsor Court," & I am very happy I did.

Located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, the "Windsor Court" is a beautiful luxury hotel, with French-inspired d√©cor.  It is close enough to the French Quarter to enjoy all of the fun, but it is just far enough to feel worlds away from the craziness once you enter into the gated private courtyard entry of the premises.  The concierge arranged private roundtrip airport transportation, & the chauffeur was prompt at baggage claim, helpful with luggage, & very friendly as he provided a nice welcome to New Orleans.  From the moment of arrival into the gated private entrance, we were warmly welcomed by the valet, front desk, concierge, bell desk...practically everyone!  

The Club-Level suites on the top four floors of the hotel are wonderful, & well-worth it.  The suite was very comfortable with beautiful foyer, living room, bedroom, powder room/large bathroom, private balconies in both the living room & bedroom with beautiful views of the Mississippi River, & great turn-down service (loved those in-house made complimentary pralines).  

The private Club Lounge (included when you stay on the Club Level of the hotel) features complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea service, evening hors d'oeuvres, & serious cocktails --- all complimentary, & all delicious!  The food in the Club Lounge was so good, there was hardly a need to venture out, but we couldn't resist exploring the wonderful city.  The Club Lounge attendants were so kind, welcoming, & helpful, we felt like family.    

Thank you, to everyone at the "Windsor Court," for going the extra mile to help make the trip to New Orleans extra special!  Can't wait to return!
