The 3rd Walden's opened on Arlington!  

What's not to love:
-Coffee is always on point 
-Breakfast sandwich hit the spot 
-Nutella Scone - so rich....did they change the recipes -- not a crumby and more banana-y???? Still yummy perfect for sharing.  
-Service is always excellent- nice touch when the barista comes over to check that he made your drink correctly.  

Good news:
Parking in front and back (not huge but a few) 
Still a bit of a secret so the lines are short. 
Walking distance from downtown apartments and hotels 

Great addiction to downtown!
