The service at Brentwood, both style and the front desk ladies are great. The ladies at the White Bridge location seem a little clueless when someone is trying to bring them business or plan a party with them. It is like a bad game of telephone- won't go to White Bridge for events and sure to tell friends if you need to organize party- talk to Brentwood. "Hi, I am a customer and I want to give you money because you are awesome..." Response @ White Bridge: "Uhm, ok"
