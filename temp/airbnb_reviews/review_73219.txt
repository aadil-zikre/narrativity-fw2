Thank you to everyone at The Pool Store for everything you do did to bring our backyard to life! We LOVE our new in ground pool! The process was easy and we appreciated Toni and Cheryl for keeping us informed every step of the way!! Cheryl was awesome as she always took the time to email me in a timely matter and was especially very patient with my millions of questions! Thank you again for a beautiful pool that we are looking forward to making many memories in!
