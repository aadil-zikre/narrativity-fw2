I grew up going with my dad to Home Depot and other hardware stores (Lowe's, Ace, Osh), and I must first admit to loving that smell of concrete, sawdust, and paint that all these stores share. 

This Lowe's is right across the street from the Salvation Army, so after I bought 2 tables, I stopped by to get spray paint and sandpaper. The staff members were all helpful, deliberating with me on the qualities of Satin and Flat spraypaints, and later aiding me to find the right hammer and nails I needed to hang things in my apartment.

After finishing one table and realizing that my hands are not made for sanding, I went back to get a sander. One manager, Rob, talked me through the qualities of each one, didn't push me to buy the more expensive one, gave me tips on how to load the paper, as well as helping me choose an oil primer (I got a can of paint because the spray was too messy and I wasn't feeling good about the environment with it). 

Even when I called in about possibly changing the paint that they had mixed, they were all about helping me find the correct items for my project and had no problem with me exchanging a product that they might not be able to resell. 

All the staff members in every department I interacted with were knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. I will definitely be frequenting this location for all my hardware and DIY home decor needs.
