I purchased a brand new Ford Explorer from Auffenberg Ford South and it was an amazing experience. My salesperson was David Runge and he went out of his way to make sure I got a good deal and I had a enjoyable car buying experience. Since then he has provided amazing service when I have any questions about the vehicle. If you are in the market for a new car I highly recommend you go see Auffenberg and see David Runge!
