I was at the Mancave the first week it was open and really liked it the owner his wife and the other barber were all cool people. The reason I am giving this spot two stars is because my recent visit with my girlfriend was a bad one. Reason being we went in for a haircut and a cigar  and we walk in and mind you its about 6pm no one was in the place getting any service and we walk up to the owner and say we both needed a haircut...he was playing dominoes with two older men and on the phone which is fine with me and understandable so he gets off the phone and says he cant cut our hair because HE IS "TAKING APPOINTMENTS ONLY BECAUSE HE DOESNT HAVE ANOTHER BARBER" he handed us his card and we walk out. Oh i have to add he is a barber too he cut my hair once..Now I don't have a shop of my own but i know one thing I would never do is let money walk out the door. I think he should've stop his game cut our hair we would've brought beer and cigars and he would've made a nice piece of money and got two happy customers who would've returned because we was looking for a new barber. I still think THE MANCAVE is a cool spot and the owner and his wife are good people but letting money walk out the door wasn't cool.
