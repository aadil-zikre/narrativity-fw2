I walked in quite by accident, mistaking the entrance of the restaurant next door.  Fortunately, I was in the mood for something new and I decided to try it out anyway.

I've never had sushi, but the menu choices were easy to follow and the men working there were friendly and helpful with their explanations.  I am pleased to say that I have been turned on to a new kind of food, thanks to "How Do You Roll?"  

I plan to visit again when I'm in the area.
