Our experience test driving new vehicles was fine, but for us the Premier Nissan experience became very uncomfortable when we agreed to let them appraise my car for trade-in value and to look at some initial numbers. They took our keys and the car's registration papers and our drivers licenses. The lease/purchase numbers we reviewed were both confusing and ridiculous (we later estimated they had us at about 20%apr), and it became clear only after about TWO HOURS of back and forth and making us wait that neither party was going to negotiate. A salesman responded to me saying that their trade in was too low so I preferred to sell my car privately: "Well, you have to be careful if you sell it to Guido down the street. When something goes wrong he might come looking for you."  At that we got up to leave, but didn't have our keys and license and had to ask two people to gather them.  

THE WORST: Two hours later, at another dealership where we were treated nicely and made a good deal, we realized that Premiere Nissan STILL HAD OUR CAR's REGISTRATION PAPERS. We called immediately and the saleswoman wasn't forthcoming about whether the papers were there, and said they would "look into it".  We've followed up with a phone call (message left) and a text (no response) and still have no registration papers.
