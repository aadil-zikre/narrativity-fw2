Have you ever poked yourself in the eye on accident, really, really hard? That's how it feels for me every time I go to the Walgreens on Lindell.

The Walgreens that's REALLY close to me (Union/Page) has been having major crime issues- not talking theft and fights, more like a murder right in the parking lot- so Walgreens on Lindell it's been for a while. After reading such great reviews on the Kingshighway Walgreens, that's probably where I'll be going from now on.

I mainly go to Walgreens for the pharmacy and it's such a challenge every single time! Once I stood at the counter (just me, no one else in line) for close to 20 minutes while the pharmacists were... wait. I actually have no idea what they were doing. One of them was on the phone with an insurance company which makes sense, and the other two just disappeared. When the lady on the phone finally came over, she made it clear that she wasn't happy to be getting me my meds. (Insert finger in eye right about now)

The drive-thru pharmacy is even worse than the inside, believe it or not. On my most recent trip, I gave the pharmacist my information three times in a row, calmly with a smile, and then she put the phone down and walked away. I assumed she was going to get my prescription, but a new person came over, picked up the phone, and said "date of birth please." She took my information again, and I finally got my medicine. I'm sure the people in the line of cars behind me were thrilled, but the same thing probably happened to them!

Creepy security guard dudes, average of 8-10 people in each line at the front, always out of Big & Sexy hair products (don't laugh, B&S hair products is my thing.)

Go somewhere else! Your eyeballs will thank you.
