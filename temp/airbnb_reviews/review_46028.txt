Prior to going to see Rain, I made reservations via Open Table for dinner. We had dined previously at Epiphany several times before and had great service and food so thought we would give the new restaurant a try. We arrived, checked in and were seated immediately, only to be ignored for the next 15 minutes. Once we got the attention of a server who seemed confused, said she would be our server, promptly told us there would be a corkage fee for our bottle we brought but had no apology for us having to wait. Then a man comes over (owner?/rude) and asks if we are a party of 14...uh no. Well we are going to have to move you! 25 minutes into this we are escorted to the 'Private Room' which is dirty and where the server attempts to clean the table spraying Windex to clean the table which then permeated the room with the smell of chemicals.  At this point I took the wine bottle from the server and said, 'You know I think we are going to go somewhere else now'. I will NEVER go there to even find out if the food is good. The people were rude and not at all interested in treating their customers well.
