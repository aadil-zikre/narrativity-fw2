The office staff have been nice and the staff and dentists seem very professional. That said, my initial checkup resulted in a recommendation to have two teeth puuled, a crown and a filling. After the filling, I noticed that food would get stuck, only to find out that the dentist had failed to establish an appropriate contact with the tooth and another tooth. I then went to another dentist who told me that one tooth was a lost cause but the other could be saved--he was surprised thst the Amera dentist had not looked under the tooth. Finally, the crown they put in failed after a year; I chose not to return and ask for a refund and so my insurance would not pay and I paid myself with the new dentist...bottom line, they appear polite and professional, with the latest technology, but I lost faith with them
