I went into the store without a clue of what I wanted to do with my front door, just knew I wanted something new. Terri took the time to ask me questions about what the area looked like now and helped me picture what I wanted it to look like.  She helped me pick out a beautiful door that totally changed the look and feel of our entry. We love it!
