We had heard about Cabinets To Go and were happy to find a new location closer to home to check out.  We had a design idea for a laundry room redo from another place we went to but were not happy with the final result. Kris and Melissa were so helpful in coming up with innovative options that we really liked - without the custom cabinet cost!
