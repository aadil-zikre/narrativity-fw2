So glad to have the use of this public transportation system. Yes, it's hard to know when the buses will run (no schedules or route numbers listed on the bus stops), but at least the passes are inexpensive to purchase and that most of the buses and streetcars are air conditioned (very important for summer usage).  We bought a 5 day pass for $20, which gave us unlimited usage. We heavily used our passes and were quite grateful for them after hours of playing tourist.
