I came here just trying to satisfy a Mardi Gras hunger- you know the one- the one where you just want to eat everything in front of you but are trying not to eat ANOTHER piece of fried chicken. Anyway, I came, I ate, I made my boyfriend order the fried zucchini, ate again, exclaimed very loudly how delicious everything was, and left feeling like I had truly tasted something special I hadn't had before in New Orleans. If you want brick-oven pizza with high quality ingredients and a personal touch, go to Echo's. Now.
