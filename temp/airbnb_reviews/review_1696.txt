After trying to adult our hardest when purchasing furniture and coming inappropriately close to spending nearly $5k on a custom sectional, I brought my reluctant SO to Below Market.  BM is part of the Kittles family and stocks the bottom of the barrel pieces that are discontinued as well as some of the less than perfect "damaged" goods.  Stock can change on a weekly basis, so you may not find exactly what you are looking for on your first visit.  Walking into the store, we didn't expect to find anything close to a match. 

Upon entering the vast space, we were immediately  greeted by Tom.  He offered to help us with any questions we had, and very much did not have a "in going to stalk you throughout your visit" vibe like our experience at Ashley.  After walking around a bit, we saw it - the perfect sectional matching everything we wanted.  After sitting in it every which way we could thing, our minds were made up and we grabbed Tom's attention.

Tom helped answer all of our questions about the purchase, delivery, warranty, and more.  He even helped get us free delivery since we were opting in for insurance.  We purchased on a Monday, and they were able to deliver our new living room fixture on Wednesday morning.

Delivery was pretty easy - they called the night before to give us a 2 hour window for when they could come by.  They originally proposed the morning, but were easy to accommodate a time later in the afternoon.  Another call came about 30 minutes before their arrival.  The delivery guys were quick and efficient, ready to place our new furniture wherever our hearts desired.

I didn't go into Below Market with high, or even mediocre hopes, but left pleasantly surprised.  You can now enjoy my reviews written from the comfort of my new sectional, 1/3 of the price that we thought we were going to pay.
