well, i followed ricca from her previous salon to nova salon when she opened it with paul. i never questioned following her, because after MANY bad hair cut/color attempts i made when i first moved here 4 years ago, i finally found ricca and decided to never let go...she is amazing. i usually tell her to do whatever she wants, give no preferences or requests and my hair always looks amazing when i leave here. i get compliments on my hair all the time to the point that i have come up with a standard reply giving her name and the salon name. the people that i have referred that end up seeing ricca or paul, become addicted like i am - they are both amazingly talented. 

it helps that the space is beautiful!!! it is pure serenity to me! from the clean white design with the big beautiful windows and skylights to the soothing artwork....it is like a little haven! i used to hate going to salons because i get restless, but i look forward to every appointment at nova!
