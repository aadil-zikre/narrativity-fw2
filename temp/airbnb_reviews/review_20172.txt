Back in February 2014, I had an incident with my car as I was driving back to Winchester, VA, where I was living at the time. While on the NJ Turnpike, I hit a pothole and did not realize that I had damaged the undercarriage of my car until I was in Pennsylvania. I contacted my insurance company, and immediately started to look up where I could take the car.

For some weird reason, I remembered Faulkner. 

I got the car taken there, and they handled everything with care and professionalism. From the billing, to the rental car, to getting the car back (which they got my car back in less time than expected, and for a fair price), I cannot complain for what they did. These folks did a fantastic job from start to finish and made what could have been an extremely stressful ordeal into just a minor inconvenience. 

Thank you guys. I know this review is 4 years late, but you guys deserve some recognition.
