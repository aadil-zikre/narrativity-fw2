A bit overdue, but I must thank the team here for saving me on an unusual day.

While driving to work on an otherwise typical morning, I begin to hear plaintive "Meows" when I pull to a stop. First thinking the "cat stuck in a tree" trope but it repeats 2 blocks further on. Same plaintive wail, same source from somewhere in front of me.

I realize 
1) I don't own a cat (ok I knew this already)
2) A cat is trapped in my car
3) How will I get the cat out? (brief unsuccessful attempt to locate the cat in a parking lot...)
4) If 3) is successful, what am I going to do with a terrified cat on the side of the road?
5) I'm going to be late
6) Hoping this little guy is not somewhere in my engine such that the very act of driving is going to hurt him (turns out to be male, not being chauvinistic)

With a 1 year old car, I have no relationship with an auto repair shop but remember passing this place multiple times. I drive into the lot, get out of my car, and Crystal (as I find out) comes out immediately to ask me what's up. My car meows at her to explain the situation.

Here's why this place earned every one of these stars:
-Two other team members come out promptly and start pulling my car forward to elevate it for a better look. 
-Crystal understands I'm late and drives me to work herself
-They call me two hours later to tell me they rescued a kitten from above the gravel shield behind the front bumper. My car is ready for pickup
-He's adorable
-They take care of him all day and also take it on themselves to try to help him find a good home
-When I return to pick up my car and they recount the tale, I ask "How much does it cost exactly to get a kitten out of a car?" Reply: "Oh, we're not going to charge you."

Not the typical interaction with an auto repair shop, so take that for what you will. But they went above and beyond that day to help me and a terrified stray kitten. I would have paid them for their effort and time, but they weren't out to take advantage. They simply did the right thing.
