I was referred to this restaurant which I live right around the corner and was displeased. I wanted to love the place because Im right around the corner but found myself very dissapointed .My maccoroni and cheese tasted loke a box of noodles and my yams were dry and could stand some seasoning...my fried shrimp and cornbread were the best on the platter.... mabe it was a bad day but I definatly wont be going back any time soon.. ghe proportions werent even bad if only my sides had flavor. I wonder if they taste the food before they serve because to csll yourself chef I think your food shoild stand out and not be so bland... :( just being honest and I love food.. The person who referred me was displeased with her platter and said the tasted differently then the last time she came...her gravy was bland.I gave 2 stars for their friendliness and being black owned just hope they get they flavor up.
