I have been here a few times for my Mother In-Law's eye appointments.

It's really not a bad drive and the parting is pretty easy with it being an open lot and not a garage. My Mother In-law makes her appointments with enough advance notice and even if it's been an emergency they always manage to fit her in, because they must.

With that said, I am not 100% sure what is with the front desk staff, I think  they at some point either had a group meeting to get it "together" or what.. because as patients walk in and stand in front of the desk, they are pretty much ignored and some patients are UP there in years so standing around waiting and waiting isn't a good idea, the girls can be abrupt and even down right rude. The last time we went, I really watched what was going on because you can be great Dr's which I have no complaints, but if your staff is rude, unsmiling, too busy to be polite and kind to the patients that are the ones that's hard earned money is going to the business, well, that's just downright unacceptable.

So, I am glad it was a different this last visit but keeping the 2-Stars for now.
