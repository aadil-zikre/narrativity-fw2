I'm not one for giving bad reviews but this is the third time that I've had bad experiences with their horrible service Department, but this incident was the last straw - I bought a new razor in for simple maintenance that I bought from them 3 years earlier to get oils filters changed (regular maintenance)and they forgot to re fill tranny/ transfer case with oil - tranny burnt up after 4 hrs - knowing that their service guys have done this before with other customer razors they paid for a remanufactured tranny/ transfer case but they made me pay for labor of $550 since my warranty was no longer on this unit- (I  pay for labor because they forget to refill tranny with oil? And they even admitted to not filling unit after they inspected tranny case)so it gets better -again they forgot to fill the brand new remanufactured tranny/ transfer case that they just installed with NO oil !!but this time I catch it before it completely burns up -so I took it back to them again and negotiated a horrible traded in value with them / us knowing about the damaged remanufactured tranny that had metal shavings In it from their service Department again not filling unit with oil for a brand new full price (no price break for their  incompetence service Department for destroying my razor that only had 100 hrs ) can am maverick and moved on from that place - my brand new can am will be maintenanced / warrantied with Big St. Charles motorsports dealership- not some incompetent service Department at St. Louis powersports - I've have bought 5 brand new Atvs or side by sides from them and it seems like the place is constantly going down hill year by year-my advice is to stay away from this place until they get their service Department in check-----
