My girlfriend and I moved here from Vermont about a year ago and we were both in need of a dentist. This practice seemed like an ideal first choice since the reviews were decent and they are located right up the street. Our first visit with Dr. Petchalonis and his staff was a positive experience (minus the hygienist smelling of cigarettes). However we were both informed that we had multiple cavities and proceeded to get them filled without consulting a second opinion. We both experienced more pain and sensitivity after the fillings than before we were diagnosed with the cavity...  6 months later at my check up, Dr. Petchalonis informed me I had four new cavities that needed to be filled. This raise some red flags so I visited my childhood dentist in Vermont over vacation to get a second opinion. Turns out, NO CAVATIES! All in all, I would say this practice takes an aggressive approach to dentistry and would NOT recommend them.
