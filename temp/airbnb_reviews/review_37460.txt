Since buying my Tesla, now I get the joy of personally hand washing my own car. Before I was spoiled by simply driving through an automated machine car wash. This was surely a whole learning curve--thankfully my sister walked me through it the first time around (laughing because I was slow causing it to cost around $15 due to cost being based on timing).

Perhaps because I don't know any better, I think Storke Car Wash is perfect and has everything you could possibly need. The one small complaint is that the car washing machine screens are difficult to see when wet or with a glare. Otherwise, it offers all the necessary features and modes including: tire cleaning, pre-soak, high pressure soap, foaming brush (my personal favorite due to the pink color and pleasant scent), high pressure rinse (also fun making me think I could fly while riding the hose lol), high pressure wax, and spot free final rinse. Each time I challenge myself to beat the amount paid last time--while doing a better wash and drying job.

Bring cash and quarters. While the washing machines do accept credit cards, it is a minimum of $4, whereas cash is a minimum of $3. If you want to purchase any additional car scents, cloths, wax, or vacuums, those machines only accept quarters.

I wish I knew about this place when Zizzo's Coffee was in operation. Though rumor has it that the owners of The Point Market are going to be opening an "affordable" gas station and a coffee shop (where Zizzo's was). I would have personally liked a Dutch Brothers or Philz Coffee :P.
