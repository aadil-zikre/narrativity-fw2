Hi, I would like three mediocre slices of pizza please and oh, can you also greet me and serve me with an attitude? I especially would like a side order of scowl-face, and if you wouldn't mind, can you gossip or speak negatively about other customers to your colleague when you don't think others can hear you? You would think that if you have an establishment in a town that receives a ton of weekend traffic, and has lots of competition, that you would go above and beyond to ensure your diners have a great experience and come back. Alternative, I guess if you are losing out on a lot of business, have limited repeat customers and probably are deep in the red, that your emotions might get the best of you, and you treat you customers sub-par (this is the only explanation that I can think of). Having read the other Yelp reviews prior, I went in putting them aside. I mean, we all have bad days right? Clearly, this isn't a bad day - maybe it's a bad year, or a bad decade, as I also fell victim to "we don't give an F about you" feeling that you will most likely also receive when ordering. The only pro's I can see are as follows: ample seating, as most people are dining at alternative locations. Kid friendly, (which I have to say, not a lot of places are in downtown), which also then might be a con for you. Pricing is reasonable, then again, we are talking pizza, so if it weren't priced to sell, then you might as well put the "For Rent" sign in the window.
