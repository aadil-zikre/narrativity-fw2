I think what I like best about these stores is the selection of furniture, the interior decorators, some of the reasonably priced accessories, and the employees when they are friendly, helpful and polite. 

What I did not appreciate was having furniture delivered to my house that was cosmetically defective. To resolve the situation, the company sent me replacements with the same problem but in different places. They replaced it about 3-4 times until we both got tired of the situation. As a final resort, they sent out a technician who did a pretty good job at painting over the defects, was rude at times and related to me that I was the problem instead of their shoddy products. I even felt the subtle ridicule from the salesperson. The only reason I can think of that I didn't request a refund was that I was expecting out-of-town visitors.

Structurally, I haven't experienced any defects. But if you inspect the outer appearance of the furniture, the paintings and the lamps, you might think they were slapped together by a bunch of uncaring amateurs.
