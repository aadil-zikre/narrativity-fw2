This was the first time buying pizzas from here and I did it based on a recommendation from my daughter I ordered a pepperoni and a white pizza and the pepperoni was okay the white pizza was burned so I made a call to the pizza place to let them know  it was burnt and a waste of money and the only thing he offered me knowing that it's going to be it was thrown in the trash was $2 off a future order...mind you they cost $24.00 for 2....overpriced brunt and not much flavor... I think that's bad customer service and it's certainly a place I will never go to again and definitely would not recommend it to anyone... I must say though the female that answered the phone was very helpful when I place my order and she was great when I made the call I don't blame her but I definitely blame management terrible customer service... it appears to be a very popular place and as I told her they clearly don't care whether I come there again or not...
