HONDA WESLEY CHAPEL BAIT & SWITCHED ME- I feel the need for this PSA after having experienced what I went through the last few days. This may be a bit lenghty but I want to just make WC residents aware- it's worth the read!
Sunday 5:30 pm: we arrived looking for a car for my daughter & she test drives & falls in love wiith a 2013 Honda Civic that was priced @$9999.
6:30 pm:  We leave & tell our salesman we wanted to shop around & would call him in a few days. 
Tuesday 7:36 pm: I text our salesman telling him we were ready to move forward & to send me the application- he replies and tells me he is out to dinner & will first thing in the morning when he gets to Honda. 
Wednesday exactly 9:00 am: another Honda sales rep texts me & then calls me that she is emailing me the credit app; she does so & I fill it out cosigning for my daughter. 
10:22 am: she texts me again & says she confirmed with the manager they have my app & are holding the car & she is grabbing the keys & my sales rep will call me shortly.
2:57 pm my original sales rep texts me "Just talked with the manager & he said with you cosigning your daughter can get the car, what time do you want to come in?" I reply 4:45- we agree to meet.
4:47 pm: We arrive to be greeted by my original sales rep & he is outside & laughing & joking & says "We sold the car BUT i promise you I have others just like it that we can make work. Mind you I am waiting for the JUST KIDDING but NO he was SERIOUS- he tells me they sold my car in the afternoon & he didnt get to work until noon & had just found out about it. It took everything from me not to leave! 
7:15 pm still there hours later & now we have test driven 2 more cars priced from $14-$16k when my original car was $9380. We are doing the back & forth negotiating and I am looking at an offer for almost $17k being SOLD to me on newer car, less miles, blah blah blah. Then he says "what can I do to get you to buy this car tonight" (remember they already pulled my credit). I proceed to tell him something along the lines that at this point its clearly about principal to me & the fact that they ran my credit, told me they were holding my car, & then sold it AFTER running my credit & the manager hasn't had the respect to walk in & at least shake my hand & apologize for the mistake, blows my mind. Then he proceeds to tell me, "Let me be honest with you. WE ACTUALLY SOLD THE CAR LAST NIGHT!" Instantly, i felt myself getting red & it took EVERYTHNG within me to not start cursing & I stood up & looked at him & said something like "That makes it so much worse!! The fact that you ran my credit, for a car you sold last night, & fooled me all day between you & another rep into believing it was here makes it unethical & disgusting. I am putting out my hand to you, please shake it, as I am walking out of here respectfully & thanking you for your time but you will never win my business." & he was shocked & didnt say a word & we walked out! This was a classic bait & switch & I will never go back to WC Honda & I just wanted to make our community aware of my experience. I am not saying you will have the same experience but I wanted to share what I went through. Thanks for reading!
