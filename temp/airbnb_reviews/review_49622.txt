Maybe it was perfect timing for a visit. I walked in today to get an idea of what decaffeinated coffees they had to purchase, and it turned into a pleasant lesson on the decaffeination process, how the beans are flavored, the history behind the business, and so on.... It was a good visit, good convo, tasted some coffees that were already made, and got some chocolate covered coffee beans to go... Glad I stopped in, and also glad to have this place relatively close to home.
