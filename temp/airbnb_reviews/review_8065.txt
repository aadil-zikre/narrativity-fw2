I was hesitant to begin crossfit for the reasons many of us have. I contacted many boxes and was disheartened when none of them reached back out to me, then came Talon, Coach Tara answered me within 24 hours and let me know about the process, and it was easy to sign up. When I arrived at Talon everyone was friendly and welcoming, I knew right then that I had found my home box. Crossfit has changed my life, is changing my outlook on fitness in the most positive way. If you're looking for a welcoming, professional, and just simply amazing Crossfit gym go to Talon you won't regret it.
