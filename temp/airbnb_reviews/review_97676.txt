I was not pleased with Mall Chevrolet.  I've brought my car to Barlow Chevrolet in Delran for years, and I love it there.  I thought Mall Chevrolet would have comparable service (and it's just more conveniently located for me), but I was mistaken.  

Firstly, my oil change was $39.95 with a coupon.  I feel like that's entirely too high, and that I typically pay 75% or less the price at Barlow.  They did an inspection for me, called me an hour after dropping my car off with what needed to be done (minor maintenance), I approved it and thought it would be ready within a couple hours.  No problem.  (I dropped it off and then went to work, so I did not sit there and wait for it)

5 and a half hours later having not heard back yet, I called to make sure the car would be ready for pickup at 5:15.  They let me know it was just finished and that it would be waiting for me when I came for it in an hour or so.  When I went to pick it up, I paid (didn't love the price, but was told exactly what it would cost during the morning phone call so no surprises), and the cashier didn't tell me anything.  Not where to wait, where they'd bring my car, nothing.  So I awkwardly requested where my car was, and she made a call.  A mechanic went to go fetch my car while I waited outside.  5 minutes later he returns saying that my car is blocked in by a tow truck.  We wait another 5 minutes and then another mechanic goes to fetch my car.  15 minutes later he finally drives around with it.

My question is why was it blocked in by a tow truck when I called and specifically let them know I'd be there for it at 5:15?  They had it for a full 8 hours, and in that time they couldn't just pull it around to the front when it was ready?  It was extremely inconvenient and not worth the trouble.  I won't be straying from Barlow Chevrolet again in the future.
