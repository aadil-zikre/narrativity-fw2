Three words about Buttter's -- DON'T GO THERE.  Made the mistake of trying this place for take-out before going out on the town,  Overall, the food was barely edible:

*  The "Salisbury Steak" amounted to two small, violently oversalted hamburgers with thick rice gravy (not even brown gravy!)

*  The "Baked Turkey Wings" were just okay, but could have been a bit more tender

*  The thick layer of gravy on the "Rice & Gravy" was possibly thick enough to layer between bricks, but barely seasoned

* The hint of soy sauce in the "String Beans" probably explain why they were salty enough to choke a horse.

*  The "Candied Yams" were okay, but I've tasted better from several other restaurants, and my own kitchen

*  The cornbread was pretty good (after I put butter on it and HEATED it) but it was such a small piece that I was forced to wonder whether or not they could actually spare it

* The "Fried Chicken Wings" were actually pretty good -- light, crispy, and not too greasy.
