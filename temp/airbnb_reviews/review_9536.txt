Horrible recent experience! 
I have visited previously a few yrs ago during the fall for the bar scene & fire pit. The recent visit has made me realize how bad the menu prices for food & esp the lack of skill set required to become a waitress there. This obese, 9 month prego look a like,  pathetic excuse for a waitress took our order. mind u they were not the slightest busy yet it took 11 minutes to return w/ our drinks, not to mention she had the personality of a wet mop & visually showed she hated her job..
To sum it up, two of our entrees were cold, she screwed up on drink orders, and at one point when she hadnt visited our table to check on us one of my friends walked over to her whilst she was chatting with a coworker & he tapped on her shoulder which she ignored for a good moment until the coworker brought it to her attention. Let's just say I left her a tip she won't ever forget!
