I've only been to Milky Way Farm post covid, and I gotta say that if you have kids, this farm is definitely a must visit! They have goats you can gently pet, lots of wild animals in open spaces, a nice corn maze with helpful tidbits of knowledge, and fresh fruits and vegetables for picking and buying. We came during the pumpkin picking season and due to an excitable kid, didn't actually get to go to the patch to select our own pumpkins, but we still had a great time. I did hear all about the amazing ice cream, but since our girl had food allergies, figured it was not the best time to indulge.

As COVID will likely continue, I recommend buying the tickets a week in advance, just in case, and have a great time here!
