I had no idea Greenstreet Coffee was located so close to where I live until my husband suggested we walk over for a cup one morning when we made the sad realization that we were out of beans. The location is so cute and unexpected; I kept thinking how lucky the neighbors must have felt when a coffee shop/roastery opened right on their block! 

We ordered two cups of coffee to go and picked up two bags of beans. We're currently making our way through the Mexican bag and I look forward to trying all of their offerings.
