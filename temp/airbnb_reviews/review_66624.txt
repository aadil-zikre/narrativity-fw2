Great food and great front of house staff. I always love hanging out at the bar and chatting it up with the bar tender and other regulars who often hang out there. Everything is seemingly perfect until I came to realize how racist the head chef is, she certainly has some strong opinions on every other type of person that's not white. It's more confusing as to how the seemingly liberal owners would keep around someone who sympathized and even glorifies the Nazi regime and it's history both European and American. I don't think I'll ever step foot in this place again or at least until it gets new owners who don't tolerate racist assholes.
