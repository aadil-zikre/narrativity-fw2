Disappointing all around.  The first two times we tried to ride it it was broken.  When we finally got to ride it we were underwhelmed.  The ride isn't all that fast and it's just not as exciting as the other coasters in the park.

It almost feels like the ride isn't going as fast as it should.  There's a hill just after the first launch where you just about come to a stop.  And during the one inversion you're going so slow that you feel like you're hanging from your restraint.  It feels like something just isn't right with the ride.

For something advertized to be all about SPEED, it's pretty boring.

Maybe they will speed it up in the future and make it the ride we all want it to be!
