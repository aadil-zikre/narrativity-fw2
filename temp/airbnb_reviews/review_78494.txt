the reviews are fake.  
the "restaurant" (sic) is part of a crave delivery service which may, or may not, be great.... but posting fake reviews is bullshit and hurts honest and genuinely great restaurants.   
Jess "joyful" M is obviously a paid reviewer, moreover, this review of Elliott's Oyster House is for the "Boise location" which even Crave says doesn't exist.  

John J.,  you need to just apologize and delete your account.
