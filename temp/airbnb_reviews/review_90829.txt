Today was a holiday and my PCP office was closed so I headed over to Doctors Express. I made sure that I was there right when the office opened (8AM) and I was the first person there. The front desk staff were nice and Dr. Campbell was engaging and friendly. I felt like he really took his time with me and listened. The entire experience took about an hour and I didn't have an appt.
