Overpriced... you can do better if you shop around. They charge a pretty high diagnostic fee to look at your car. After that, you're already financial committed, but then you find out that the work itself is also very expensive. For my job, I later found out that including diagnostic + repair I paid $150 over what would've been the total *dealership* price (so, $400 here vs $250 at the dealer). That's a big chunk of change for nothing more than a door lock actuator replacement! There is no excuse for being so more expensive than the dealership, as the whole point of going to an independent shop is that it's supposed to be cheaper. With auto shops all around, you owe it to yourself to try somewhere else first... even the dealership is a better bargain!

They are also sneaky about up-selling additional repairs, for example saying that they wanted to replace my entire air filter unit because of a missing cover, which would cost over $300. I decided not to, and later on I took my car to Dobb's for an oil change and emissions test -- they said the missing cover was okay and replacing it would basically be superficial. I think some people who gave positive reviews of Azar didn't even know they were being up-sold, because Azar won't be too pushy about it, so you *think* they are an honest group. But then if you opt for maybe just one repair, then they've come out on top, because there's a pretty decent chance that in fact none of it was really necessary. Overall, I feel very upset that the other reviews gave me the sense I would get a fair price here -- quite the opposite happened and I would say buyer beware. Very sneaky shop, the "charm" is just a facade.
