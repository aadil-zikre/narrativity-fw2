I have moved a few times in the past few years and have mourned the loss of a great stylist in each city because they can be so hard to find. Luckily I found Element right after moving to Nashville and was scheduled with Christina for a haircut. She discussed the picture I brought with me and made suggestions on how to make it work best for me. My haircut looked great and, more importantly, it still looks good and styles easily several weeks later.
