Scheisters all of them!  Asked to see a specific car but salesrep immediately steered me to another car.  When I refused to test that, had audacity to have me sit for ?15 min & brought up another (lower model/yr) car they thought was "better fit" for me - without even asking!!   When I balked & asked again about first car I had seen online rep claimed they never check the online site....but there it was on the lot.....with price several THOUSAND more than what was posted online - rep also claimed didn't know that or why price dif.   But when you go online to check stock, reps take turns being the "chat" contact!  So I'd say tactics used here are WORSE than the typical dealer......specly the imp who hovers.
Note - it is totally ILLEGAL for dealers to check your credit using info from your drivers or car license without your agreeing to it.  Never never allow any dealer to photocopy your license - they just have to eyeball it to make sure its current and your pic matches your face.  If they balk, walk away.  
Jokes on dem cuz I had time to waste so decided to waste lots of their test driving 3 cars.  Then hemmed & hawed & KNOWING I could have bought all of them CASH, but cuz they disrespected me from the gitgo refusing to show car I first asked about (that was on the lot) I walked away.....bought new car CASH few days ago at competitor.
