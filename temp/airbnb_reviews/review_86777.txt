A lot of my friends like coming here for the hibachi experience. I think the food is alright and not super authentic but it's a fun experience. As Abby (another reviewer) has said, they come out with a gong for your birthday so you can get the full attention of the room! Their prices are reasonable and it is a fun place to go with a group but I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time or it could be a long wait!
