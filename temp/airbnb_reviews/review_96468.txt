Back in the day, I never needed a place like this. Because I would always repair or replace my own cellphone screens. But nowadays I just don't have the time. So a facility like this is perfect for me.

This was my second visit to this location.

The first visit went a little like this: I scheduled my repair online, I dropped the phone off, 3 hours later,  I was contacted advising my phone was ready for pickup, I returned to pick up my phone, checked in on Yelp, barely got my freebie because the tech said the check-in offer was old & he didn't think the owner would honor it, but the owner did indeed honor the offer, I paid for the repair and I was out of there.

The second visit went a little like this: I scheduled my repair online, I had to modify the appointment due to a scheduling conflict on my itinerary, I checked in on Yelp, I dropped the phone off, the gentleman advised he was unsure if he'd be able to get it completed before the close of business depending on the flow of customers, one hour later he contacted me and said the phone was ready, I returned to pick up the phone before 7 PM at which time they closed, and I was out of there.

Both times, it was a simple stick & move caper; which if you read my reviews you know that I love those.

Pros: 
-Scheduling online
-friendliness of the staff
-availability of same-day repair

Cons:
-parking isn't the best
-the repairs can be costly, but hey, we need our phones 

I'd like to say this is my go to place, at least for my android phone repairs. Hopefully I won't be returning anytime soon and that's the prayer.
