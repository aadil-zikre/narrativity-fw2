Having read many excellent reviews for Dr. Janet and her staff, and being new to Nashville, I made an appointment today for a cleaning and check-up.The front office staff were welcoming and friendly, and later very helpful at check out.  My hygienist, Jessica was wonderful, very thorough and personable, explaining things as she went along - she also did a great job with my cleaning.  And then, Dr. Janet - fabulous.....professional but funny and I felt like she did a great job recommending a plan for some future dental work, without being pushy.  I totally trust Dr. Janet.  I will definitely be going back!!!
