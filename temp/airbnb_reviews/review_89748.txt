Dominique made my hair fall out and this is the honest truth. I am a blonde and she put me under the heat lamp which caused my hair to become mushy and break. When I left the salon I got into my car and I instantly noticed my hair falling out (see picture), this lasted for a good few days. I understand that her procedure is to "speed" up the process but using heat on my already fragile hair is not ok, a professional educated stylist/owner should know this. Also during my visit she snuck in a $28 treatment called "olaplex" and didn't even ask if I wanted it, the only reason I know is because she whispered it to the shampoo girl and I saw her using it in my hair! The total before the additional retail product I bought was $120, no hair cut, no blow dry, just highlights (and possibly the olaplex that was snuck in)! Dominique seemed like a nice lady at first but as time went on I realized she was very unprofessional and clearly didn't give a crap that she was destroying my hair! All she did was talk about her personal life and her previous employees! I've been going to this salon on and off for 4 years (I used to see someone else) and I've seen quite the turnover, hmmm maybe it's the owner? It's clearly obvious Dominique doesn't care that she's ripping off her customers and destroying the way they look! Stay as far away as you can!!!!!!
