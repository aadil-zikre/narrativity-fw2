No matter what you've read about the Florida Strawberry Festival it's literally impossible to get a true sense of what it's all about without visiting. This was my first time here and it wasn't close to anything I could of ever imagined prior to walking through the gates. I had heard before arriving that this event is rated one of the top forty Festivals held in the US each year and if one would judge this event simply based on attendance you'd never question the validity of that statement. First fact - parking is a fiasco I felt as if I was driving on a parade route with all the flag wavers bidding for my green backs to park on their front lawns or their defunct businesses, hey I'm all for capitalism but these guys can be pretty aggressive, not too far removed from the carny folk wanting you to throw balls at a set of milk jugs or pick up a floating yellow duck to win a plastic whistle.

I suggest taking the extra time and drive as close to the main gate as possible, odds are you'll find a space for the same price as the guy that's offering a space ten blocks away, believe me you'll do plenty of walking once inside while navigating through the funnel cake and chicken kabob vendors - I guess my expectations were a little unrealistic, there were a number of strawberry exhibitions but they are limited and kinda all the same just named differently, seriously how many ways can you make a strawberry shortcake using the same ingredients. The games and rides were plentiful and the people watching was epic, that in itself is worth the price of admission, if you're able to find a bench in the shade you'll be entertained as long as you're able to stand the aromas of the giant corn dogs and kettle corn...
