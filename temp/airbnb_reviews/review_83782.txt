took my car in here on a Saturday @ 4:30 and didn't step out until 6pm. UNREAL

ok ill give them that it was a Saturday afternoon but come on 1.5 hrs for a regular $16 car wash???? at least give me a heads up on how long my wait is going to be before i can decide if i should go forth with the service! 

although the exterior car wash made my car shining like new, upon getting home i discovered that on the passengers side seat there were little white paint marks?! (possibly extra cleaning solution on the pants of one of the glass cleaners who sat in the seat when wiping down the interior) which managed to find its way into the crevices of my black leather car seats. tried to scrape it off but to no avail. I will have to find another solution just to take this mess off! help !

next time i will be doing the wash myself at one of those self car washes and save myself a hour of my time
