At this point, we've received a cease & desist letter (via email) from this company's counsel, asking us to not only remove our original review, but also provide a written retraction -- which would, in essence, be an admission of dishonesty. 

We continue to stand by our original review as an accurate representation of our experience and feel it's unfortunate that a company, in response to a negative online review, would go immediately in the direction of threatening legal action instead of working towards a solution that could appease both parties. Again, we our original request was for a partial refund, not a full refund, because we believed it was fair the original inspector be compensated for his time. We later increased our ask to a full refund due to our frustration with not being able to connect with the company directly for a number of days. 

I would've considered increasing my review by a star due to the likability of the original inspector, but I can't just say "meh" to an experience where a company has attempted to bully my wife and I into silence. 

I am not disbelieving of others who have left positive reviews for this company, so maybe this was just an anomaly for them, but it's also possible they've bullied others into removing negative reviews. That said, I feel it's important that my personal experience remain on here for their potential clients to weigh against other reviews.
