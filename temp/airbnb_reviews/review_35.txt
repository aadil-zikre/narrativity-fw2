That 's how yeah , I do quite a bit of running and then I just got onto the subject of is it okay to still burn and then she said absolutely and she told me that she 's had other mums who are pregnant running and that obviously maybe feel much more ease that this was n't , you know , alien and it is okay and then I just pretty much asked every time as it Hello kay at my still. Okay , you 're not. You know , I 'm not doing anything silly and I 'm listening to my body and taking it pretty easy. And and then I asked the stenographer when I had the scan and they said yeah , of course , it 's fine and I think yeah and for me I thought yeah. Well it must be okay , then , you know that they 're dealing with pregnant women on a daily basis and ones that run to so it 's okay. It was actually more the people around me my family and friends who were like it. It 's okay. Are you sure ? Yeah , and it was actually them that pose the question a bit more than the health professionals. Yeah , and you will find yeah that people are a bit like oh , what are you crazy ? Hmm ? Yeah , I can imagine because I 've seen reactions of that or like , you know witnessed it and like I always think you know when it comes to time where you know , I decide to have children I died , you know so long as I 'm healthy and happy and I get to go ahead I would want to still continue running because well , I think I think in a way like obviously The health professionals that yeah , it was fine. I think sometimes if your if your body so used to exercise you do it regularly in a way. You 're you 're almost not my fiance more in danger. But like your body needs it like you ca n't just just stop just like that
