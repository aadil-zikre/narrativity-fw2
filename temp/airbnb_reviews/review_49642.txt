Common Sense Brewing was the 85th brewery that I have visited in NJ alone.  Although I don't think I would have ever gone there if I hadn't been determined to go to every one in the state, I'm glad that I did.  Part of my mission to visit all these breweries is to stake out all the breweries so that others can read Yelp and get an idea for which ones they would like to chose to visit.

Although it is true that the atmosphere is nothing special, and although it is true that the beer is not at the pinnacle of beers in NJ, there is something distinctive about Common Sense Brewing.  I found that it is probably the most kid friendly brewery I have visited.  This is a nice place if you have kids, don't get out as much as you would like, but you just want to enjoy a flight with your other friends who have kids.  There are games for them, and kids are encouraged to design these circle tags that get displayed on the wall.  

In general, there's a calm feeling in the brewery.  The bartender gladly chatted with me a bit.  I also liked how it is located in Downtown Bordentown.  Although I had driven by on Route 130 before, I had actually never been in the older part of town.  Bordentown is really nice.  It's not huge, but there are lots of shops and restaurants there, and it's a good alternative to going to larger downtowns such as Princeton, which have difficult parking.
