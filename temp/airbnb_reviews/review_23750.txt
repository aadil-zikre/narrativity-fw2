Oh the great American dive bar, it never fails to
Make me feel like I'm going to get stabbed for my IPhone 8 and AirPods.  That being said the drinks are super cheap the regulars are sketchy and loud. In other words I love it and if you don't, just walk away man! 
I have no idea if they have pool tables or a jukebox, because the bartenders have stone hands and keep pouring till it hurts. If you are a fan of people watching and love idiotic conversations,Do yourself  a favor and pull up a stool. Just don't forget the hand sanitizer!
