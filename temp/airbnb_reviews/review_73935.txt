I flew to Kilimanjaro Airport via Nairobi, Khartoum, Cairo from Amman, Jordan. I was greeted and cared for from the minute I got into the airport. GE took care of everything for 6 days of touring throughout the Serengeti, Ngoorongoro, Lake Manyara, and Tarangire areas. We saw all the big 5 and the medium 20 and the small 40 animals--all the wonderful beasts. I felt that our guide, Rafael, really wanted this trip to be special for us. He was informed and personable and a great guy. The food was good, the lodging was beyond good, and the trip was fantastic. One thing that GE didn't tell us is that the Visa is, I think, $100 which must be paid in cash--US or Euro--and there is no ATM at the Kilimanjaro airport. This caused some problems, but Raphael took up a collection from his guide colleagues to get one into the country and then he took the long drive to Arusha to the ATM to get more cash. Come with dollars and don't expect any ATMs. I will remember this trip for the rest of my life! It was wonderful.
