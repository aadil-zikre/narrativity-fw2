This CVS is easy to find but hard to get to if you're coming from the other side of the street. 
Would be nice if they were 24/7, but they are not. The staff greets you as you walk inside, and are helpful if you need to find something. be sure to use your phone number linked to your rewards card to save some money on certain items. We've been here many times, but this trip we needed some medical supplies, and we found everything we needed. So all went well.
