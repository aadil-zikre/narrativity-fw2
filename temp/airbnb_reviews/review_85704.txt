I had to try this nail salon out since it's literally 50 feet from my house, so the location is stellar! The staff are always friendly and welcoming when you come into the door.
The space is very clean and modern, wall to wall white with floor to ceiling windows.  (This makes for fantastic people watching!)  You will be offered, water, wine or tea during the treatment which is a nice and relaxing touch. The salon is pet friendly, so you could bring your pooch in if you want. There are usually three pups in here- Princeton, Duke and one other I can't remember her name- which can make it a little hectic when they see other dogs walking down the street- but I love when they come and plop down on your lap for a visit!

I do wish that they had a larger selection of Essie colors, but I have my own stash and bring my bottles in so it's not an issue for me, but I had forgot my bottle once and had to find a color and they didn't have the usual suspects- I also miss my massage while my nails are drying, but its a good trade in for having such a great mani/pedi experience.

I like that it is open until 10pm, so I could potentially put the kids down and run over and grab a quick mani-  that is if I wasn't on a toddler sleep schedule...
