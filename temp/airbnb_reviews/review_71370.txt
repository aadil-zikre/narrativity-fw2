Totally love this store-It was my first time here and I had heard so many good things about this place.

If you are planning a visit here I suggest two thing-number uno plan on setting a aside a few hours 2/3 if you are in a shopping mood also please come with a shopping list or else you might just go crazy trying to buy every deal you see.

This store has a huge variety of everything with home,men,women,children sections.Lots of inexpensive things.Their actual price range is also on a lower side and hence you just don't need to look for sale items.I actually bought all these thing-CHECK MY PHOTO-for around $50.I'm actually writing this review after using most of the things I bought.I bought a silk pj suit for I believe $12 and it is great quality it has already been through a wash and has passed my test.My 3 pair of socks were $1 and the quality is so so amazing I can't stop raving about.I picked a pair of light pink sneakers for $7 and they are super comfy too.

The highlight of my trip was my purchase of a hamsa pen which I thought was so so cute.It was $2.50.

This store is another reason I would love to visit Philly again.
