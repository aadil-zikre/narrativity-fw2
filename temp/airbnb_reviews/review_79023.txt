I went to Lindsey for my root touch up and highlights. I have been going to her for several years and she's always done a fantastic job interpreting whatever it is I've requested. She is also going to Barber school so she has an ongoing commitment to honing her skills. The shop is easy to get to, friendly and has reasonable prices also.
