I went to see Katie based on the many positive reviews I read on Yelp.  I have fair skin with pink undertones and came in requesting ash blonde peekaboo highlights.  The reason I specifically requested ash blonde is because I know that with my coloring, warm colors such as gold or caramel would not look good on me.  I came in with many pictures and examples because I knew that with the specificity of what I was requesting, there was very little room for error.   

I really liked the way that Katie placed the highlights, but the color is a warm caramel-y blonde and did not look good with my skin tone.  Additionally, Katie wasn't very friendly and aside from offering me a few magazines and giving me the salon's wifi password, she didn't really go out of her way to make me feel welcome.  She told me that I was "thinking about it too much" when I asked questions about what the color would look like and how it would complement my skin tone.  Changing your hair color is a major decision and to me, that's something that warrants a lot of thinking.  I appreciated that Katie was honest with me about what she thought would look good and what wouldn't, but didn't particularly care for her attitude or the way the actual color turned out.
