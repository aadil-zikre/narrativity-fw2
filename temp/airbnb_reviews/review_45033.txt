I have just bought my first car with Tom Wood Volkswagen and it was a pretty enjoyable experience. Shopping around these past few months has brought me to quite a few dealerships in the area looking for the car that would fit our needs.

Mike Thompson was the 'lucky' one when I walked through the door but I feel lucky having received his guidance as I went through the final decision-making before buying our Toureg. He knew the car from top to bottom, bumper to bumper. Not once did I have the feeling he was just humoring me until my husband got there. And that, from a woman's point of view, is extremely important.

I left Tom Wood Volkswagen with my new purchase feeling as if the people who worked there really cared about me and my car. They thanked me for my trust in them and I really do believe they stand behind their cars. We will see how it goes as we travel the path of working with the service department but if the 'front' of the shop is anything to go by, I have very high expectations from the rest of the TW VW crew.
