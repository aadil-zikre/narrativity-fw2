I don't want to totally put down this Great Clips.  I'm sure it does a great "no frills" hair cut like previously mentioned.

My roommate went here and complained about his bad haircut.  Knowing that it really depends on the stylist (not the whole salon) I gave it a try and received a horrible haircut as well.  My boyfriend ended up going there a week or so later (I didn't warn him) and he got a bad haircut.  The three of us ended up talking about it and discovered that all three of us coincidentally had the same stylist.  None of us could remember her name, but she appeared to have a permanent scowl on her face (even when first meeting).  Although she spoke like she was educated in hair-care, she gave both my boyfriend and I the worst haircuts we have ever had.  If you're going to try this location, just make sure you get a stylist who is at least smiling when you meet them.  Hopefully you'll be in the clear!
