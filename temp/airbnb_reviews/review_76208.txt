For some reason, I've been to this place like 5 times in the last 6 weeks (all on Saturday nights), so I feel pretty well-informed.

Good things:

- awesome windows bring out my inner exhibitionist and allow for a great view of Whyte
- 2 levels, 2 bars, 2 sets of bathrooms
- I have no complaints about the bar service - it's typical for a busy nightclub
- fun atmosphere, all ages (18+ obviously) have fun without feeling too young/old
- no cover and the line isn't a problem until midnight or so

Bad things:

- the Saturday night DJ is really...let's just say there's so much room for improvement. He'll never ever play a requested song, the song transitions make everybody cringe, there's no rhyme or reason to what he's playing. When I am drinking, I will dance to anything, but cutting songs off mid-way and playing the most random things ever doesn't make me buy more drinks, it makes me want to leave :(
