Great way to get a feel for the city--its architecture, its history, its music, and its food--in a relatively short amount of time for about $50.

The Esplanade Tour covers about 10 miles or so in about 3 hours (yes, all that for around $50). It's an easy ride on cruisers but you do ride in what at times can be heavy traffic. You don't necessarily have to be fit or even remember how to ride a bike (or even be familiar with the rules of the road when it comes to bike riding) because this really is an easy ride and Bob is sensitive to the riding levels of the group.

It works like this: Bob leaves the bikes outside your hotel, gives you a call about 5 minutes before he gets there, and then you ride to meet the rest of your group at their hotels. Riders are generally limited to 6 or 7 per trip which allows riders to get to know each other and hear what Bob has to say at any point on the ride. You start off on the river, skirt the French Quarter, see the Frenchman street clubs and a bit of the Marigny, spend a lot of time along Esplanade, stopping at the St. Louis cemetery and fairgrounds, ride out to city park and then back through the Treme, finishing at Congo Square. Along the ride Bob shares the history of the city, points out damage done by Katrina, sells you on some of the local clubs and restaurants, and gives a quick overview of some of the most prevalent architecture in the area. He didn't go in to much depth anywhere we stopped but the whole point of the ride is to expose you to what NOLA has to offer to allow you to come back to those points of the tour that most interested you.
