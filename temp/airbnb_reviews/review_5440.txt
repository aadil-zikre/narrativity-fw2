On a recent trip through Tucson we decided to give this place a try as it was recommended to us because of its asian-Caribbean fusion menu.. it was easy to find, plenty of parking 

We decided on the mofongo combo that came with one protein entree.. I went with the carne frita (fried pork).. the combo comes with a cup of chicken soup (flavorful chicken broth.. tiny pieces of veggies and chicken.. but not much.. the broth was delicious)

The bf had the combo .. fried rice, garlic shrimp and yucca.. his shrimp smelled heavenly.. the garlic was the real mvp .. yum!  He thought the yucca would be different not fried, but he enjoyed the fried version 

I added an order of tostones based on yelp reviews and they were good.. hint of garlic .. served with mayo-ketchup 

You order at the counter and they bring your food and silverware to the table. Small dining room area

Looks like they do a lot of carry out orders, portions are a good size so a lot of dine-in orders were served in to-go containers, ours was on plates with real silverware not plastic. 

I would return to try some of the other options, everything smelled really good.
