Took my Nissan Juke here last Monday 12-22-14 for an oil change and tire rotation.  Staff were super friendly, didn't wait very long to have my car serviced, and price reasonable.  Wasn't to pleased with how the young mechanic drove my car in and out of the garage though.  Other than that, no other complaints.
