I try to give credit where credit is due and these guys deserve it! I sent my elderly friend to this Speedway location as she lives close by and was having starting problems with her trusty Buick. I also thought her tires needed to be replaced as one on the rear looked like me.. ' low, old and crusty'. 
After her visit I found out that her starting problem was just a bad connection on a battery cable which they fixed for free! They also repaired the tire I thought was bad, told her She was OK with her tires as she never drives on the freeway. (what do I know?) The only thing they charged her for was the overdue oil change so she got out of there for around 30 bucks for everything! These guys are the real deal, and I wasnt surprised its just like the service I've got in the past at some of their other locations. Thanks guys !
