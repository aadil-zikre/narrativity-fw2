Our daughter has been enrolled at L'il Tykes since she was three months old.  The staff at L'il Tykes made the transition back to work as easy as possible for my husband and me. We knew that she was being properly cared for each day.  From starting off with bottles and moving onto eating food, her teachers have helped us decide what works best for her.  I believe that the teachers at L'il Tykes have helped us develop her into a sweet, out-going little girl.  Now, she has moved up to the Young Toddler room and loves going to school each day.  She gets excited each day when we pull into the parking lot.  Each morning, she walks into the center and stops by her old Infant room to hug and say 'Hi' to her former teachers and then she moves onto her classroom for breakfast. My husband has to go through the same ritual of saying 'Bye' to all of the teachers in the evening.  It is very comforting to know that your daughter enjoys her time at daycare.  She loves participating in circle time, playing with the other kids and especially loves her weekly visits with Ms. Rose, the music teacher.  We are very happy with the choice we made in enrolling our daughter at L'il Tykes and would recommend the center to other parents.
