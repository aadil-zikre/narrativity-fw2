I went to Raymour & Flanigan to shop for a living room set and had a certain set in mind but when I walked into the showroom and saw all the different choices I became overwhelmed.  Thank goodness Deena came to the rescue, we chatted about my first choice which wasn't in the showroom but then she showed me others that were similar in color and style.  I fell in love with a Granite colored leather sofa and chair that were the perfect size for my smaller living room and Deena even had furniture moved from other locations of the store so i can pick just the right accent chair.  I never felt pressured to make a decision and after two hours of shopping I finally made my choice and was good to go.  The furniture was delivered on time and the guys were great and assembled the pieces. Love my new living room and can't wait to show it off!
