When we were looking for reviews of car wash and detail companies in Edmonton, we could only find them for Cupid (good) and Bubbles (not so good).  Then we found the ad for iCarwash Auto Detailing where it stated that iCarwash "provides premium auto detailing service to the public using pressure steam car washers. The state-of-the-art pressure steam car washer with our eco-friendly detailing technology distinguishes our service in terms of quality and time-cost efficiency".  I called them and spoke to the receptionist who was pleasant, helpful and able to answer all my questions as to procedure, timing, etc.   We went ahead with the full steam detailing on our 2009 Toyota Matrix and were satisfied with the end result. The trunk area would have cost extra to clean but we did not go ahead with that as it did not need it.  Afterwards, we were happy to see our vehicle so clean and shiny.  Our car hadn't looked as good since we drove it off the lot!  We are certainly impressed by the level of service iCarwash provides, both in the work done to our car AND in their customer service.   We plan to use this company again when we next need a good cleaning.
