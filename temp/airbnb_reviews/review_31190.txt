I'm pretty bummed about feeling the need to write this review. In all honesty Imperial is a great place to get piercings for a lot of reasons. The shop is very hygienic, the piercers are informative and really make you feel like you're in good hands! My biggest complaint is the customer service at the front. I have been into the shop multiple times with friends getting piercings and to buy jewelry for myself...the last time I went in I left feeling like I had to say something. Customer service may not be the most important aspect of a piercing/tattoo shop, but the people at the front desk always make me feel like I'm a nuisance and a chore to help. I'm not one to make complaints and I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt, it's taken going in 4 different times and being treated the same way every time to finally speak up. The level of service this place can provide is being seriously hurt by the way the two people at the front treat customers walking in the door. I would never tell someone not to go here, but I would definitely let them know they won't be walking out feeling good about the way they were treated by certain people in the shop.
