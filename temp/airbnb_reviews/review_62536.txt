This was my second time visiting uno. The first time the service was great. The food was lackluster at best; however I wasn't expecting authentic Chicago deep dish anyway and the location is convenient for a quick bite. Our visit tonight included pretty bad/dumb (seriously) service and was also bad food wise. The waitress seemed new (read: dumb).  She lacked standard wait etiquette I would assume intuitive like taking the menus/clearing the cramped table between courses/refilling drinks/forgot to bring an apron for the kid's make your own pizza etc. A manager came out and inquired about our food; she was the star of the show clearing our table and asking my son if he wanted something else when he didn't like his pizza (he liked the burger much better). But what was pretty dumb was the waitress coming out asking "would you like anything else, are you sure" when I answered no and yes respectively she said "no to what being sure or not wanting anything." At that point I was thinking "umm we'd like you to be a normal waitress and clear the table bring out the food we're waiting for refill our drinks etc then ask me if I need anything else" Awkward: come the whole hell on and never again.
