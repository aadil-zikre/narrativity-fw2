I had a great experience at E-Z Rent a Car at Tampa. I found them through Orbitz and they were the best deal. I had just come from Payless Rent-a-Car down the street and had a horrible time after they had lied to me and tried to charge me extra money. E-Z Rent a Car on the other hand was great. They gave me the car at the price they quoted me. They offered me the extras as "options" and didn't force it on me. They were straight forward and answered my questions honestly. I had a misunderstanding with the contract, and the manager Daryl got back to me right away and apologized for any inconvenience. I had a great experience with E-Z Rent a Car and will definitely use them again in the future.
