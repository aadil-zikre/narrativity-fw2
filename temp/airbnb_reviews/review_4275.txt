We went here after reading another persons blog.  We have driven by it numerous times but never stopped.  The blog we read was about the great fried tenderloin sandwich (called "Hoosier Daddy") and since we are big tenderloin fans we decided to give it a try.  We went on Saturday around 4PM, and were the only ones in the restaurant.  I ordered the "Triple Play" which is three mini sandwiches--your choice cheese burger, fried chicken sandwich or mimi-fried tenderloin.  I choose one of each----I LOVED the mini-tenderloin, enjoyed the chicken, and the burger was ok.  I upgraded to Onion Rings and was dissapointed they were not homemade.  They offer a tower of onion ring appetizer which are homemade, so I was confused why they give you "out of the box" onion rings as the upgrade (the meal comes w/fries).  Both the chicken and tenderloin were hand dipped and the batter was crispy and flavorful and held up nicely (meaning the breading didn't fall off when you bit it).  I had lots of pickles and nice thick slices of red onions, which I really appreciated (they offer lettuce and tomoatos which I passed on (but my boyfriend got and they looked really fresh.   My BF got the Hoosier Daddy and thought the sandwich was good (which in a normal persons book would be great) and his fries were ok. 

We will defintely go back and I will get the fried tenderloin sandwich--it was really that good.
