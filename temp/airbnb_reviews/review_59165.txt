This has to be one of my favorite restaurants... ever =) When I used to live here, it was my family's go-to place for special occasions. Now that I'm back, it was already my birthday-dinner choice, and it was just as great as it's been. Their buckwheat savory crepe choices are mouth-wateringly well-seasoned, both if you go from their 'suggested' list, or if you make your own. Their sweet crepes are made with a lighter wheat, and, well, you can't really go wrong with any of the combination options. 

The wait staff are always helpful and friendly, they have great specials, and while their by-the-glass wine list isn't very extensive, it does not disappoint. They even figured out how to put a candle 'in' my dessert crepe for the obligatorily embarrassing singing of "happy birthday"
