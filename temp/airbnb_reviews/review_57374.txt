After looking at cars at dealerships and online, I bought my 2012 Nissan Altima from Josh Street at Newton Nissan.  I didn't personally see the car until I got to the dealership! I found online as an internet special (y'all whenever you buy a car, ALWAYS check the specials)!!!!

Because I keep crazy hours (you know, work 8-5 and then workout from 6-8:45), it was not always easy to get me on the phone.  However, Josh was PATIENT!!!  It was easier for me to either email or text and Josh went with it.  I never felt rushed or like an inconvenience.

Josh also took me on a tour of the dealership and introduced me to the service and cashier and went over all the manuals with me!

The Finance Director, Rob Fox, was really patient with me too.  He went over all of the paperwork and made sure that I understood what I was signing.

Although Newton Nissan is a 45 minute haul, it was well worth the trip!  I got the car for way under the sticker price and I didn't feel like I was being pressured or at the mercy of the car dealership.  If I ever buy another car, I'll definitely come to Newton Nissan!
