FRAUD ALERT! KEN'S TIRE, OIL CHANGE, AND AUTO REPAIRS 
6501 66th St. N, Pinellas Park, FL  33781
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Mike, owner of Ken's Tire, Oil Change and Auto Repairs advertised a car for sale as a 2004 Audi.

I want to inform you, the general public of the highly dissatisfactory experience I had purchasing a car from Ken's Tire, Oil Change and Auto Repairs, fraudulently advertised by the shop's owner, Mike.
I was also misled by Mike to believe that the car I purchased only required very minor repair, which was replacing its faulty throttle sensors. 
To my disappointment and shock, the car broke down on my way home. I was forced to tow the car to my personal mechanic, who soon confirmed that the car had a lot more problems than I was led to believe. First, the car sold to me ended up being a 2003 Audi, instead of the 2004 model that Mike advertised. Second, Mike who owns and operates his shop as a mechanic would have and should have known the car I purchased already had a blown head gasket, a faulty clutch, and dysfunctional all-wheel drive transmission, just to mention a few. My mechanic eventually quoted me at a whopping minimum of $4,800 plus any other needed repairs on the car I had just been fraudulently sold. Upset by what is evidently a deliberate attempt at fraud, I immediately reached out to Mike to express my dissatisfaction. Getting no tenable explanation to the surprising turn of events.
Frustrated by the lack of a resolution up to this point, I am using this medium to warn others of the dishonest business practices that could be expected when dealing with Mike and/or Ken's Tire and Oil Change. I am convinced that Mike's integrity and that of his business have been severely compromised.
Thanks for your precious time, and in anticipation of your support.
