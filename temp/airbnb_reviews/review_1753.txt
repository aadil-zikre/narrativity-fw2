I had a positive experience working with Ray. I reached out for an estimate for a fix after a car hit our fence. He was prompt and detailed in his response and provided a very well priced fix with an explanation of the work to be done. Had our neighbor not got his nephew to fix the issue, we would have 100% gone with Ray.
