One of the best shopping experiences in my life! Both sales representatives Bruce and Chelsey were extremely helpful and nice! Very engaged but not pushy at all, worked with my budget and my needs rather than trying to sell me the most expensive product they have. Very knowledgable, Bruce took his time to help me pick exactly what I need and both Bruce and Chelsey worked with me on the exchange (nothing they did wrong, it was a manufacturer error). Delivery was prompt and exchange was fairly painless. I definitely felt like both representatives were going out of their way to make me feel comfortable and to help  accommodate my needs. Would, without a doubt, recommend this place and next time I need a new mattress I know where to go :) huge thank you to both of you!
