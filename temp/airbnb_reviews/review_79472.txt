I'll start this out by saying - as you can see from my picture - that this was the best service technician arriving message I've ever gotten.  I loved that they provided me with a photograph of the person arriving, it adds a feeling of safety and security for when I answer my door.

Second, Billy, the plumber who arrived, was pleasant to speak with, reasonable, professional and he did a very good job installing a new toilet in a more challenging space. My house is approaching 85 years old, so things I have found in the world of repair and replacement can be ... interesting.  

He was careful to disclose to me all the fun things that could go wrong that would result in a higher cost, he was efficient and thank goodness none of those things were wrong, so we had a new toilet.   

I used the Yelp quote service to hire Valdel, and I have to say from start-to-finish they were all responsive, professional and the whole replacement felt effortless.

I would definitely use them again and would recommend to others. Thanks Yelp for pointing them in my direction!
