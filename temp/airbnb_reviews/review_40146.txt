I don't really understand why this restaurant has any good reviews. My friends and I were running late on a Friday night and we didn't end up getting to Criniti until around 8ish. Apparently they close at 9 but didn't bother telling us when we walked in. We noticed that we received weird glances when we walked in but didn't think much of it. Our waitress hurried us to order and informed us that they would be closing soon. I'm sorry but I don't  like being rushed when I am going out to enjoy a nice meal at a restaurant. Since clearly we didn't know they closed so early and they were rushing, why didn't they bother telling us and we could have found another place to go to? I also noticed that the crowd that was there was much older and my friends and I felt really out of place. 

I did not enjoy the food at all. The lettuce in my salad was not cut up and the only dressing was oil and vinegar that was on the table. The pasta was bland and had a horrible sauce and their food was mediocre. I was not happy when I left that place and I will not be going back again.
