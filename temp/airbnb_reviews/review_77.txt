We moved into smart sound and smart blinds and in the future , there 's going to be many more interesting areas and each of them have some kind of a special need and they have to be treated in a way that kind of honors their specialty rather than saying this is a certainty Information architecture , there 's on and off and up and down and and we can do this in very symmetrical ways. So I 'd like to think that we can go a little bit deeper into understanding the needs specifically. I 'm wondering how do you align all those things you were just talking about like the lights and sounds and those kind of things. How do you make sure that everything is aligned ? I know that from visual design or from UI design. We have designed systems kind of but you ca n't use them for Different touch points , right ? So how do you do ? How do you do that ? That 's an interesting question and it is not that easy because there is no Playbook. So to say for the smart home or for internet of things a lot of the industry 's kind of weird , you know charting our path as we move forward. I would say we have quite a lot of principles that we have crafted along the way that is helping us out quite a lot. A lot principal a set of principles is this similar to a design system you can say but just to give an example. For example , we have a principle called escalator principle which has a lot to do with meaningful Innovation. Imagine an escalator even when it fails to work. It is still set of stairs. So it still works to a certain degree
