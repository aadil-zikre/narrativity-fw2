I wouldn't wish this company on my worst enemy. I would literally beg you not to use them. They gave me a quote and tripled it when they arrived. Tried to call the "corporate office" and they couldn't help, that's when I realized,This is a chain company that just hires people off the street to move your company. The movers they brought admitted to this being their first day. 2 of them walked off the during the job. I had to call the police, cry and it took them two days to move me out of a townhouse. Their business plan is to over charge the people of Cherry Hill because it's a "rich area" they bring movers that haven't been trained. I'm not sure how they are legally allowed to move people. This move was the worst experience of my life. This company is a pyramid of companies that just choose place to plopp down hire professional people to run the phones and hire people off the streets to do the moving. I tried to call there "corporate office" and quickly learned these people have no customer service, if your move go wrong, no one will help you, no professional and no insurance. It took us two days to move out of a small place and when ended up having to call the police even the police said they were scamming. Some workers "before walking off" said that they specifically prey on people in cherry hill and south jersey because "they have money to blow" 
No matter what they quote you when they see how nice your stuff is they will triple it. They take advantage of women and people who have money and I wouldnt wish this moving company on my worst enemy and I pray you avoid it. Try MS Moving Of Cherry Hill, or Suburban Solutions of Philly. Those are the companies I've tried before and they are amazing. I could kick myself for trying a new and unorganized and unethical business like this. The fact that a busy person like me found the time to write this mean I care and I don't want the people of my community taken advantage of. Again. I pray you avoid it.
