The service I received here was the worst I have received anywhere. The general manager Charlie should not be dealing with customers and there is a reasons why no one ever meets him and he is in the back somewhere. The salesman Don was about the only good part of my experience. 

I went in on after finding out my 2003 outlander was on its last leg (a car that was purchased by my grandmother from this place brand new in 2003) I walked in ready to finance a car with a good chunk of money down. We found a car that I liked but didn't totally love until I drove it. Since it was late we couldn't get bank approval but I gave them my info and the info of my cosigner and they said they would make sure they got the price I needed for my budget (I am still in college and work full time and made my budget clear from the second I walked in) so they let me drive the car home. Needless to say, I fell in love with this car. After a week of back and forth calling and leaving messages, I was absolutely fed up so I drove over there ready to make a deal. 

I was greeted by Mike (another extremely friendly sales man) and we test drive another car that I saw online that I loved even more, and the cost was 2000 less. Well somehow this ended up being the same price when they tried to break it down so I said no. 

The part that made me walk out was when Charlie walked over and was extremely rude to me. I am in the business of customer service and I know that you never treat customers the way I was treated. So I walked out and caught a 60 dollar uber home and they watched me walk. 

My family has purchased numerous cars here over the years and I can confidently say we will never return. I recommend you and your families do the same because they will rip you off.
