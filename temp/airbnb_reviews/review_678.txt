I'm saddened that Northeast Pediatrics will no longer be treating children who aren't vaccinated. I realize this is a hot topic right now, but I really thought NEP was above jumping on the bandwagon. I've recommended your practice to people in the past, but now I have to tell many people to find another doctor to take their children to, because you're ostracizing those who choose not to vaccinate for religious/personal reasons. It's your practice, and you can do whatever you please, but, like I said, I'm deeply saddened that you're going down this road.
