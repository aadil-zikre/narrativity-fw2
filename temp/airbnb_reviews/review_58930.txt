Being a bride your dream is having the perfect cake to go with your wedding theme but in my case my worst nightmare happen. My wedding cake was to be delivered at my wedding venue in delran nj at 10am it wasn't delivered until 2:30pm due to traffic. When my cake was displayed I Immediately started crying because it was supposed to be a 4 tier cake with coral colored ribbon detail but what was delivered was a 3 tier cake with orange colored ribbon detail. The worst part was that the cake came slanted and leaning over so bad the venue had to find a prop to make it appear even. When the bakery was contacted they refused to refund the venue for my cake and put the blame on the delivery drivers from their bakery but if you ask me your delivery service should be trained on how to deliver a cake since it does represent your bakery. I will never recommend this bakery.
