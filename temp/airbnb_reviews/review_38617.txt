Two years ago I purchased my beautiful Siberian husky from this location, this was single handedly the best decision I've ever made. It was a great value for the extraordinary customer service and the plethora of outstanding advice I had been given from the extremely ecstatic and joyous employees who so welcomingly greeted me with a smile at the front gate, although I was shocked to hear them tell my wife she could not bring her hand bag rather she had the option to simply set it in the cubby they supplied or put it back in our car, it was for very good reason. I can certainly understand the concerned employees fear of a puppy being snatched up and put into the wrong hands potentially being injured or sold to a family unfit for a puppy, I could see the concern in the employees eyes as they told us. Not only were the employees incredibly brilliant but they were surprisingly nice, outgoing, and had the answer to every single question I had about any breed I took interest in. From the moment I walked in the door and was greeted with a heart warming smile to the moment I stepped out with an adorable puppy, his new squeaker toy, and a bag of food that I found is best suited for my particular breed of dog, I was flabbergasted with the superb experience provided from this All About Puppies and would recommend them to ANYONE looking to purchase a new four legged furry little family member. The puppy even came well groomed, smelling of the sweetest aroma a puppy should have, and wrapped in a cute little bandana, they certainly deserved every star I have given them.
