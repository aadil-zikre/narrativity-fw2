Walked in this clinic with my 6yr old daughter who wasn't feeling well and encountered something very distressing. As I was filling out forms for them to take care of my daughter I asked about a particular one which required me to hand write my credit card information and I'm very small letter at the bottom said that if they felt the services provided weren't covered by the initial payment they would go ahead and charge the credit card and that I would get notified of this charge only if the transaction was over $200.00. I specifically explained the receptionist that I would be paying out of pocket for the visit and also I provided my insurance card, the office managers response was that this was a requirement that the owner had placed and there was nothing they could do, I asked if she was refusing to service my daughter and automatically changed her tone and said that they would assist her but that I needed to provide the information. Long story short they checked my daughter I paid out of pocket and didn't provide such information and when she told me to keep in mind that next time I would need to provide it I happily responded that there wouldn't be a next time. 

Worse experience at a walking clinic.
