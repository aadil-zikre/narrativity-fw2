I decided to go with Candelight and Roses because they were pretty good at getting people in the door (after a visit at the wedding faire). We decided to go with a bridal boquet, and three brides maid boquets as well as flowers for parents, and groomsmen. 

The flowers were beautiful, and very vibrant but I feel as though my boquet which was a hundred dollars more than the brides maid boquets was lacking. It was almost the same size, and same flower selection. Also some of the flowers all ready looked like they were dieing. 

Don't get me wrong, they were still beautiful and photographed fine, but for what we paid I was expecting something more when I got my boquet. I could have just as easily went to Sparks Florest or Toms in Carson, but I would order from Candelight and Roses because they were friendly, and did still do a decent enough job to compliment the rest of the attire.
