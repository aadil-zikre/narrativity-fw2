In reference to the service department -

Will never be bringing my car back here again. Went in to get two tires (I provided) mounted, balanced, and a four wheel alignment. They tried to charge me $108 for the labor in mounting/balancing the two tires because they were "low profile". The total came to over $200 for JUST the mount/balance/alignment. I called Reddell Honda in Murfreesboro, where my car has been serviced its entire life (7 years) and they quoted me just over $100 for the same service. I mentioned this to the Crest service manager when I arrived to pick up the vehicle. He informed me that "I had already signed the paper" and agreed to the amount. We went back and forth for 15 minutes about what was "fair" and he ultimately discounted the service +/- $20.

Honestly, the whole experience just felt underhanded to me. I overpaid $60 to learn a valuable lesson -  never bring my car back here.

Oh, and one more thing - they also called me before the service was completed and tried to upsell me brake service that I didn't need.
