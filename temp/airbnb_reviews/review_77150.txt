Open til 10pm! That's 5 star worthy itself; most other locations close at 8pm. 

When I walked in at 8:30pm I was promptly greeted by Kristen with a warm smile & pleasant hello. She asked the reason for my visit, collected necessary information & payment then kindly escorted me back to a pristine room.

Mikki on vitals 

Haley on assessment 

Gaby on meds 

Dr. Dinkel on lead; it's no wonder everyone was so awesome. Dr. Dinkel came in the room and quickly put me at ease. He shook my hand, looked at the infected area, gave instructions to his assistant on additional meds to administer and broke it all down to me in laymen terms. Further extended his hospitality by telling me although this visit should be sufficient; he'd be working the next 2 days if I needed to return to see him.


I received follow-ups via email & telephone; this made me feel loved. My foot was remedied within 5 days.
