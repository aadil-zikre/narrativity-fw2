Went here today for my first ever bikram session. I'm impressed by what the other students can do (and a little intimidated thus far by the limits of my own flexibility) I enjoyed it and feel good, and I'm looking forward to going again.

As such, my first time thoughts are below: 

Make sure you get here in plenty of time (20 minutes in advance) so that you can sign in and get set up  - the room gets full fast and you'll want to be near the teacher the first time. The staff are really receptive to questions before and after the class too, whether on other resources to help you and any health concerns you have.

The room is clean and comfortable, with very few distractions (besides the heat & smell of everyone else sweating, which is admittedly a little off-putting), although it's very full, and the instructor speaks very quickly, which is something that takes a bit to get used to if you're used to other forms of yoga. 

My one concern is the cost: while I found a special (and affordable) deal, the regular cost of $140 a month seems a bit ridiculous for what you get, and it feels that the setup should be much nicer for that type of money (doors on the entrances to the changing rooms, perhaps?). Also, everything in the front (yoga clothes, water, etc) is ridiculously marked up. I don't have enough experience to know if this is 'the norm' or just this studio,so I'll reserve judgment until I've done a few more sessions or hear from others about what's usual price-wise!
