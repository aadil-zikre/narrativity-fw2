Take a trip to France here at Le Petit Mitron, it's is a great experience. You can definitely satisfy your sweet tooth at this cute bakery shop filled with friendly staff and delicious sweet treats.

I came here looking to try a sweet croissant. I discovered that not only did they have different varieties of crossiants from chocolate to cheese but also other delectable french pastries to explore.

Make sure to get there early because they make there pastries fresh and they may not have your pastry of choice avaliable if you arrive late due to it selling out. Overall I got the almond croissant and a raisin danish and it was buttery sugary flaky goodnesss!
