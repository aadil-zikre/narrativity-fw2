Percy Warner Park is my favorite park to go on a hike on a gorgeous day. Though it's pretty much the destination for anyone in the surrounding area I for some reason never feel that it's actually crowded. On any given sunny day you can see couples canoodling on the green spaces, families at play, doggy owners throwing sticks, bikers tackling the trails, or random once in a while hikers as myself slowly trekking around Percy Warner. The place is gorgeous, nothing more need be said.
