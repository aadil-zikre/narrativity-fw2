I just moved to TN and was looking for a store in Clarksville. I do not feel like driving to Nashville every time I need something. I was already getting disappointed by the local selection of clothing and department stores, when accidentally I found Dillard's. The moment I walked into the store, I was greeted by a very friendly sales associate. I looked around at every department, and everything seemed very organized and nice. 

That day I was searching for some clothing, so I looked around and went to Vince Camuto and Antonio Melani departments. The sales associate that was helping me was very flexible, patient and helpful (I tried about 20 pieces of clothing since those brands were new to me). I ended up buying several things that were on 65% sale. I can't say that the selection is the best, but associates are super friendly, the store is conveniently organized, and so far it is my favorite store in Clarksville.
