Tagging a long on a friends family hike, I have never been to this park before but I always love checking out some place new and being outdoors.
This park is a park of the Indy parks group, when we went there were a lot of people there but thankfully I didn't feel like we were on top of anyone.
Together as a group we hiked around for awhile and took in the sights, I was impressed with how well maintained the trails were, I appreciated them being cleared out and easily walkable,
We stuck along the River for awhile and then walked over to a pond with a small bridge and sat down for awhile.
Overall great time and I was happy to be able to get outside and enjoy some fresh air, I think it's because it's the Midwest but I'm a big fan of being outside when I get the chance. I'd visit again!
