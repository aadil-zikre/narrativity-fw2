I hate to write bad reviews and it is unfortunate that I have to.  I have recently come back from traveling several states and my car was filthy.  I knew that a cheap car wash would only get the layer of dirt off and I was prepared for it.  I decided that the automated car wash was the easiest method.  After I was done I saw a sign on top of the vacuums that said they were now accepting credit cards and I was stunned and excited, but when I went to find the credit card vacuums (or so I thought), it was only the car wash itself.  I did not see any place to make change so I decided to come home.  When I got home I looked at my car more closely and found that it was almost as dirty as when I first went there.  It looked awful. I hate that I wasted money on a car wash that I could have done easier.  I am going to have to go to another car wash just to get it looking decent and I would never recommend this place for car washing needs.
