Was heading to the Boondock from Saints & Sinners back on 2/23/13 but Johnny's sits right next to it...The Boondock looked a bit too crowded and loud for my taste so I backtracked about 5 steps and grabbed a stool at the bar...

Can't speak for other nights and times but on this night this place was a drinkers bar!! Crowd was pretty thin pre-midnight and it was perfect if you wanted a dark, dingy, quiet joint to just sit in, get tight and conversate...

Credit cards are accepted but you gotta run a minimum $10 tab to use it...no big cause that's 2 mixed drinks or 2-3 beers to clear the limit...and let's face it you ain't stopping in here just to grab a drink to go!

I loved this place and the bartendress mixed a stiff $5 Dewars & water...I gotta create a list just to put this place on it...
