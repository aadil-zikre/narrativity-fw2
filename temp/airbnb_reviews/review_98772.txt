I called this florist from California to order flowers to be delivered to my sister-in-law for her 70th birthday. I was told that a lush bouquet with her favorite yellow lilies and other flowers would cost $200. That seemed very high by California prices, but it was her special day. I was expecting a fabulous arrangement with tons of flowers. This is a photo of what she received. Very underwhelming. For that price, I could have sent her two much nicer bouquets using 1800 or FTD, but I wanted to try and support a local business. I order flowers frequently and know what a "lush" arrangement costs. 

On top of that, my niece told me the delivery experience was horrible. I had asked for a delivery window the day before, which they were unable to give me. They promised she would be contacted before the delivery. Instead, my niece received a call that said they had left the flowers by a door. My niece ran downstairs and looked all over their complex and couldn't find them. She called back and they went back to wherever they had left them and finally delivered them to the appropriate place. All of this could have been prevented if they had called before delivering the flowers instead of after they had left them and driven off. 

All in all, I feel like we way overpaid for a bouquet I could have bought here near San Francisco (not a cheap place to live) at our local grocery store for $40. And the delivery was ridiculous. Would not recommend.
