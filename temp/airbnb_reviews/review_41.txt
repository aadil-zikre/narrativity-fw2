I really fucking edit my own videos. Yeah , I really spend literally four hours capturing different angles and shots to give you an eight minute Vlog. Yeah , I fly out and do one day trips to Alchemy or San Diego to go see Jason just to go and fuck with the guys that I look up to that. I want to learn from that. I want to be around because you were the some of the people you fuck with out of his in five people you fuck with or 10 people. I do n't know what it is. But however , many of those people that you need to fuck with and your the some of that that 's that 's I believe. And to sit here like and it you know , if I could go back if I was sitting down I just walked into Muskingum University and I walked into my house and I went ahead and talk to Stu in 2006 and told him all this the dude what a fucking he would have died laughing and Spilled his like beer bong with Steel Reserve in it or whatever the fuck I was doing back. Then he would never have believed me. He would have laughed me out of the fucking house. If you want something bad enough go and fucking get it and I do n't mean do n't and it does n't mean to create a framework of instant gratification. But put your fucking head down and create a roadmap if I sit down and I make 440 fucking videos that are entertaining and educational if I start helping gym owners for free on the internet every day
