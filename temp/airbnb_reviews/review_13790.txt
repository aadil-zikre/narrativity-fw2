AVOID THIS PLACE.  Pretentious and rude staff and owner.

We went here for dinner after a show and after we paid our bill we were asked to leave becuase they had a reservaton for our table even though there were open tables.  we told the hostess we were staying for the jazz and she left.  a few minutes later, the owner came to our table and asked if the hostess explained that the table was needed for reservations (we made reservations too). when we asked about the open tables, she said that we have overstayed our reservation and kept reminding us what time our reservations were for.  For 3 of us, the bill, with tip, came to $170 so it wasnt like we dropped only $10.  As we were rising from the table, the owner continued to berate us about overstaying our welcome and insisted that we "need to understand" that you can't stay for jazz at 7:30 for a 4:30 reservation.  My friend said she didn't need to understand anything because she would not be returning and shockingly, the owner said good, don't come back.  We were so embarrased to be asked to leave a restaurant.  we are 3 professional women who went after a show so it wasn't like we were college kids acting rowdy.  The owner actually followed us out into the street continuing to explain her reason for asking us to leave.  The way the owner should have acted was to explain to us that they had reservations waiting and offer to move us to the bar and even offer to buy a drink for our troubles (although we would have declined a free drink becuase we had already had 2 glasses with dinner).  I am simply amazed that the owner and hostess asked us to leave instead of offering to relocate us.  I will never return and I will make sure to spread the word to avoid this place.
