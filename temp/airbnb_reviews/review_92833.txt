I routinely visited Steak & Shake when I would skip classes during my junior & senior year of high school. This place is known for their thin patty, double-decker burgers and great french fries (get 'em with the cheese sauce to really get the full experience).  

They used to have hands down the best lime shake (well, lime freeze as it's actually called), but have stopped making it. A major loss.

Whenever visiting home, this is a kooky place to come at the wee hours of the morning to witness lots of crazy characters and drunken teenage kids who haven't learned how to handle their alcohol yet. Food is no longer great and service is terrible, but it's nostalgic...
