We stopped in on a Saturday evening after coming to KOP to go to a different Mexican joint that we'd just discovered had closed. The place looks pretty dimly lit, but somehow the tables are situated under the lights, providing plenty of lighting for dining. After being seated, we were brought complementary chips and salsa, which was actually pretty good.

I ordered three of the cheese enchiladas, which came with Mexican rice and refried beans. I received only two enchiladas, and just decided to call that third enchilada a loss because I didn't really want to wait any longer. I did mention their mistake, and asked them to make sure the bill reflected what I'd received, instead of what I asked for. I also asked for jalapeños with the enchiladas, which I thought they'd forgotten but it turned that the jalapeños were inside the enchiladas- but I was glad that I had more jalapeños to put on top of them because the chili sauce was very bland. The cheese was sharp, which made them taste very cheesy, but the sauce tasted like close to nothing. The refried beans were also a bit bland, but the Mexican rice was okay.

My boyfriend, however, found his Mahi Mahi tacos to be very flavorful- and they certainly looked it with a nice presentation that had a beautiful array of colors.

Our service was actually pretty slow. A little bit after we ordered, we heard a huge crash in the kitchen, which could have been our waitress and also potentially our dishes- as we didn't see her for quite a while after the loud crash.

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again, but I wouldn't travel all the way out to KOP for it.
