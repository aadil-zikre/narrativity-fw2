Wow, I'm speechless on this one.  As a proponent of massage therapy, I thought the whole discounted massage membership concept seemed like a good one.  But, I tried several therapists at several Massage Envy locations and was ready to quit because I felt that most of the therapists were beginners, didn't have the experience necessary, were clumsy, and didn't have their  "listening ears" on.  

Many of the therapists are trained to do half of the massage with their elbows, and knuckles, instead of hands (can't stand that) and when I would ask for them not to use their elbows, they would say okay and then go ahead and do it anyway.

Finally, I found a Massage Therapist at the Sunset Hills location that I liked. But, the last time I went, she forgot to peg one of the commercial table leg pins and while laying on the table, I went down with the table, over a chair, and hard.  

Clearly bruised, tender and shaken when I left, they seemed concerned and were great about making sure I had ice and was taken care of.  They told me if I needed to go to the Dr., they would take care of it, but when I did and the Dr.bill came, the owner refused to pay it and now I am in court  trying to get the Dr. bill paid.  Needless to say...  not a good experience..
