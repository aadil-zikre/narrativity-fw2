I love, love, love this place!  I've been transitioning into all-natural and all-organic body, hair and skin care products, and this place delivers!  There is a product called the Clear Face Blend that is FABULOUS!  As an acne sufferer for over 10 years, this stuff clears up my acne and leaves my skin glowing!  Compared to the prices I've paid for like products that are laced with chemicals and not as effective, I'm more than willing to pay what she charges.  Like other reviewers have said, if you're into a more natural approach to what you're putting on your skin and in your body, give this place a try!
