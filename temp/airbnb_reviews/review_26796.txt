This place is awesome. 

First,  a disclaimer: I don't smoke cigars,  and I usually head in and head out,  so I can't comment on the comfiness of the chairs, etc. (but everytime I go in here,  there's a different group of chaps hanging around and having a conversation while generating their own clouds of smoke and they always seem friendly and look relaxed). 

Gazing past the haze (which is totally to be expected in such a shop) and behind the safe doors of the humidor, this place is great and the customer service is fantastic.  Every time I visit my brother on the east coast, I go here to purchase a cigar for him. He's a new dad and has exchanged his personal cigar budget for nappies, so I always try to leave a little present in his humidor case for him to find and enjoy. As a buyer and not a consumer,  I have no idea what is good, so I just go in there and share my budget and tell them what he's liked in the past, and they always pick something new. They are respectful of my price range (not high by any means) and I never feel like I am burdening them by asking questions or making such a small purchase. More importantly, my brother has yet to receive a cigar he didn't like... so in addition to their kindness, they also have have outstanding taste!
