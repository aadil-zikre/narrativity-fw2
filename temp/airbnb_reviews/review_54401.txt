Delicious honest food, hard working sincere people, great vibe. Hands down the best eatery in Media. I love that everything at 320 is always so fresh and healthy and the staff is typically warm and welcoming. The owner even waits on people and will come around to make sure customers are happy with their meal and the service. I love their earnestness and genuine care for their customers in an effort to put out a proud product that makes people happy. It truly feels like the local community market you see on TV where you run into friends and the staff not only knows your name, but what you like. I really like what 320 brings to Media and I always feel good spending money there because I know I'm getting an excellent value for high quality food and I'm supporting a really sweet hardworking family. You can't go wrong with anything you order at 320, the worst thing about this place is deciding what to get! I recommend the Eggplant Parm, the Italian Special, the creative Grilled Cheese of the Week, and anything in the display case.  Definitely don't leave without grabbing some pico & chips or some artisan cheese--best cheese selection outside of NY. Enjoy!
