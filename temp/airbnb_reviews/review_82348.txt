First time I came here was on 3/1/14. I had came here to reduce my monthly bill and they carefully explained that I had the best package despite the fact that I was late paying the bill every month. The staff here is nice and helpful but it's like whenever I come here to try to get my monthly bill reduced, they always carefully explain how I have the best deal. I know I should switch but money is tight at the moment and I need my wireless internet for many reasons.
