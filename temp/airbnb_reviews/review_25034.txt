I had a long day at work and accidentally took too long of a nap after and by the time I woke up a lot of places for delivery were closed, and I was really only left with fast food options which I wasn't really feeling...

In stepped Kin's! They were open late, had an extensive list of all my favorite comfort Chinese food, at some really amazing prices! We snagged some fried dumplings, crab rangoon, pork lo mein, and their combo dishes that come with entree, fried rice and a delicious eggroll. Seriously, I know takeout Chinese eggrolls are usually all the same, but for some reason these absolutely stood out! They were super fresh and the filling was really flavorful, and it brought joy back to my tired soul! Plus, you can't go wrong with sesame chicken and sweet & sour chicken... That sweet & salty fried mix is perfect for when you're feeling a little run down, which is definitely needed during a pandemic.

They're fast and the orders are large, cheap and super filling, and fresh so now I don't even have to worry about cooking tomorrow, so it was a triple win in my book! My husband has already decided that this is going to be our go-to Chinese spot, especially since they're open late and right by my work so I can grab some on my way home in the future!
