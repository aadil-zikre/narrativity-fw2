That 's Loosely based on Forgotten Realms , but we 're in a land that 's across the ocean across from the sword Coast ocean. That 's a whole new land and I 've done full revamp of what 's going on over there. So I 'm not using the Forgotten Realms continent over there , which was called. One of them is called revin are Is one name you can find for it , but the other name is like Stiga from chroma know there 's like a CH our name to it. It 's above as Tikka. So it 's north of estiga. There 's another name up there for but revving ours want them to so this has been really fun because it 's a West marches style heck scroll there in a dungeon at this moment very very combat heavy. They 're not big our peers. So we 're not getting big monologues. We 're not getting NPC interactions , it 's mostly just clearing out this place of evil. So it 's been pretty fun. Wednesday got rescheduled which is my to Annihilation , but it 's my really fun War wizard that I 've been playing
