My 4 1/2 year old daughter started swim lessons this summer at the DeMont Family Swim School with no prior swimming experience.  The swim staff at DeMont helped her become comfortable in the pool within a few lessons.  Their ability to make swimming fun and enjoyable took the fear out of going under the water and transitioning to moving independently through the water.  In a few short months she has moved from back floats and diving for rings to learning how to make big scoops and her favorite move belly/bottom!  As a bonus, the indoor year round lesson are great! I would highly recommend it!
