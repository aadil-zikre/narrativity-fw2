It's really hard for anyone to find fault with the quality of the service provided by Tesla.  Both the corporation and this location really go the extra mile - they've done a number of repairs on my Tesla at no charge to me.  Additionally, whenever I bring my car in for service they've got a whole crew of qualified people ready to jump on the job and get things done.

That said, the service department here really drops the ball in the follow-through department.  Time after time, I've asked a question or made a request and someone has assured me that they'll get right back to me.  However, each and every time I've never received a call back!

Heck, even the technician I talked to on the phone most recently confessed that he didn't think their call center was up to snuff - this is obviously a problem that local management needs to address. 

I trust that a manager will read this review and take the appropriate action.
