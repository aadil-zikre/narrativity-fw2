Great food and service for a late dinner, not really the typical dueling piano bar. The dance floor is covered with tables (even after they aren't being used for dinner service) and the piano players rarely play at the same time. The piano players knew the songs requested and were great single acts. The bar was pretty empty by 11:30 without a large dance floor.
