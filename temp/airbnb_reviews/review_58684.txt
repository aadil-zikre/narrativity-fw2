This Sams Club was much needed in central Pinellas. We used to have to drive up to the one on Park Blvd when we lived in St. Petersburg. This store appears smaller than the Park Sams Club, but I am not sure that it is. It appears to have the same amount of stock and I have been able to find everything that I have needed in this location. I also love the cheap gas you can get out front if you are a member. It tends to run about 3 cents cheaper than the best local price 

The only downside that I experienced with this particular Sams Club was the amount of time it took to get our membership cards. We purchased a Groupon and stopped in before work to redeem it. It took about an hour total. We had to wait in line for 25 minutes for the two employees who each had a customer each to become available. Then, we were called up to the employee only to find out that she couldn't do the Groupon and had to call a manager to the front desk. She had to call him twice. He eventually showed up and we eventually were able to get our cards and coupons, but it took an hour. We were also told that they may be out of one of the coupons and that I may have to come back to get it switched out (shouldn't they know that and automatically do it?).  Poorly ran customer service wise...then again, they are associated with Walmart. 

Luckily, I have been back many times since that first visit and I have used self checkout. Those shopping trips have all been employee-free and wonderful. I would recommend Sams Club...just be prepared to wait if you need to go to customer  service.
