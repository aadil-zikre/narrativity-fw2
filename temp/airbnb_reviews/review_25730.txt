This is yet another place that makes their underpaid employees dance unnecessarily. I hate embarrassing situations, which is the reason I can't watch "Curb Your Enthusiasm," so witnessing this spectacle is like dying a thousand deaths for me. 

The food is not terrible, but I'd rather go to Nifty Fifty's for a cheap, overcooked burger with a side of kitsch. 

But I mean, it's South Street, what do you honestly expect?
