I come from years of intense deep tissue massage for my migraines, ear issues, shoulder and multi level gained back fusion. After moving & trying many many so called deep tissue therapists I failed to find anyone I could justify paying for. Desperate & discouraged I found Jaci on yelp and honestly it was not like at first visit. After my 1st visit I didn't know what to think, certainly NOT what I expected or wanted but intrigued me so I returned. Still not convinced I liked her techniques but there was something that kept me coming back..for close to 2 yrs now. Her approach is not what I was used to our even what I wanted but I began to feel relief despite it. Jaci became much more than just a massage therapist, she has been instrumental in my making major changes in my life. Slowing down, began (now love) yoga..decreasing my stress so I might enjoy life. Her knowledge is far superior to any therapist I know (being a nurse u know many). If I say my wrist hurts she will go push on one spot in my elbow and yup that's the pain! She doesn't waste time with trial & error if let's c if we can.find the spot, she knows right where to go and what to do. She has found so many areas I never knew were causing pain, never knew my hips were uneven and often our. I could go on and on, but I must say she is the best massage therapist I've ever had and her prices are reasonable. She is worth every penny and then some. The only drawback is that she has limited hours as this is her second job, but deal with it..she's worth it!
