Now , I do want to say and put out there that if you use the thougths system if you use Majors only or you use like all of these have dabbled in all of them awesome , they 're not any less valuable. They 're not at all invalid. I just personally prefer the RWS system because that 's what I started learning. Now that does bring me to the topic of what to start with in terms of a Tarot deck.
