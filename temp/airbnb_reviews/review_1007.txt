I went to RMS today to purchase some riding gear (helmet, goggles, gloves, lock [all of mine has disapeared since my last move :( ]) and the team was extremely helpful! Two employees worked with me, and they didn't seem like they were in competition to "make the sale" which really made my shopping experience fun and enjoyable.  They were both happy and gave me wonderful advice on the best gear to purchase for street/dirt riding.  The store is fully stocked with plenty of inventory, has a nice and simple layout, and is very clean and organized.   I will be returning to have new tires put on my bike soon.
Ryan Toomey has some sweet style ideas for how to look like a bad@$$ while playing it safe on the bike...I love my orange helmet, pink goggles and purple and green gloves!
