I wanted to send a friend flowers for a special occasion, but considering she lives nearly 1,000 miles away, I had to turn to Yelp for guidance. Petals by Irene was one of the first results and, since they work with Yelp's delivery platform, my life was made easier as my info was already stored as part of my profile. 

In just a few minutes, I selected a pretty, modern arrangement, crafted a personal message, paid for the flowers and moved on with my day. Delivery was $25 which is STEEP, but I really loved the arrangement and was willing to pay for convenience rather than spend more time shopping around. 

After placing the order, I received a confirmation. On delivery day, I received a photo of the flowers! This was such a nice surprise that made me feel confident with my purchase. My friend received the flowers as scheduled and said they were beautiful. Very pleased with my experience and would recommend Petals by Irene to anyone ordering from out of town (or in town!).
