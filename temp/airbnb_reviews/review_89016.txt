Have been coming here for years (since the $1.50 days). They recently ruined a skirt that I only wore once. When I picked it up, it had black, tar-like fingerprints all over the front and the back. Had I not examined it before putting it in my car, the hourly employee would not have said anything, and they get themselves off the hook with a generic tag that says, "Sorry, but we've tried to remove the stains on your garment." As it was, I took the skirt back and complained to the hourly employee. Her answer was to send it back through the dry cleaning process, to try and remove the black fingerprint stains. This (sending it back through the dry cleaning process) was done two separate times, unfortunately for me- to no avail. 

Be warned, the owner is never there, and if you call with a complaint- you just reach one of the hourly employees, who will tell you to email the owner at his gmail address, at which time he will argue with you about his many years of business experience. Bottom line, they have no customer service skills, other than collecting money and processing orders. The most unfortunate thing for their customers is that they have no remedies in place for when they make a mistake. As other reviewers have stated, you obviously can save some money here vs. a full service dry cleaners, but in the end- the old adage "you get what you pay for" rings true... After the experience I had, I will not be back.
