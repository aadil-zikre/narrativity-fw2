If I really want Pad Thai and my car and my fridge are both not working, I guess would come here, but I have to say I'm not at all impressed with the food here. I hate to say bad things about this place because I want so much for it to be good, but I just feel like they are only making an half-assed attempt. I would recommend Heng's Thai in Springfield or Viman's in Folsom if you can handle a couple more minutes of driving.

No complaints about the service from my one visit. In fact I felt the other customers there were very rude and difficult. I could tell they were going to make a lot of fuss even before they complained and it kind of ruined the experience for the rest of us too. 

However, I feel like the restaurant is in part responsible for attracting only the grumpy old ladies clientele. If only the food was better, then more reasonable customers would come back.
