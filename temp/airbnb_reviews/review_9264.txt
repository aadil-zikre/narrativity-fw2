I went in for a free consultation. I was seen promptly, although the appointment took longer than I expected. Overall a very positive experience.
My review would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the pushy sales rep (obviously paid commission) that they had me sit withat the end of my appointment. If you generally try to make responsible financial decisions and don't enjoy being badgered into something you don't have the money for, stay away as "receiving a quote" at the end of your appointment makes you feel more like you're at a car dealership than at a medical facility. They pressure you through "exclusive" discounts, threats that the price will go up in a couple of months, and everything in between to have the procedure tomorrow, even when you were just told it would cost you $3500+.
