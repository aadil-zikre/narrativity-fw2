I bought a used car from these folks over the phone from 300 miles away. Keith Grassi handled my sale. Not only did he patiently deal with all of the headaches of a long-distance sale, but he came and picked me up from the train station on his day off.

 Bommarito could have sold the car to a local and not had to deal with the aggravation of a long-distance buyer. I'm grateful Bommarito and Mr. Grassi decided to deal with me in lieu of an "easy" local sale. Their price and customer service made it worth my while to buy from them and travel 600 miles round-trip instead of buying local.

And to top it off, I f*king stole this car from these people. They sold it to me for so much under retail book that I have to feel sorry for the poor sap who traded it in, because I can't figure out how they sold this car to me for so cheap without hosing the previous owner. Maybe they offered such a great deal on a new car to the previous owner that he was willing to let go of his trade-in for a song?

At any rate... whoever traded to Bommarito the car I now drive, the trade must have worked out for the previous owner, and it worked out for me, and I'm sure it all worked out for Bommarito -- after all, they're in the business of shuffling cars for money!

 Thanks Keith Grassi and thanks Bommarito! I f*king love my car!!
