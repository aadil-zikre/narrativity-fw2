A wolf in Sheep's clothing.  They fooled me, and did not keep to their word.  The truth is, originally the company told me they were going to clean out the home including cabinets, closets, furniture, television, junk, bric-a-brac etc. ..... Sounded amazing!   Instead, they took the valuable pieces of furniture and home goods, leaving everything else they did not want (that was not the original agreement)!
On One Call Clean Out's first trip, the company essentially fooled me by doing a great job.  The next time they came to the house he tricked me by "making a deal" to not do the entire clean out of the cabinets, closets, garage, but to take all of the furniture and miscellaneous items in the home we originally discussed!  Instead they filled their truck with items they "wanted"!   I am aware that the company needs to offset their costs by re-selling the property, but to pick and choose what they wanted and not fulfill the original agreement, is where the complete and utter disregard begins and ends.  Hence, leaving me with having to hire another company to move the items they chose not to take!  Bottom line, get everything in writing, and I mean every item...,
Also, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!
