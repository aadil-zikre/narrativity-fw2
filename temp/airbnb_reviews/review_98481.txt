My fianc√© and I just moved to the area and have been searching for a new church home for the past two months when I came across the Yelp reviews and decided to give Keystone a try! As evidenced by my 5-star review, I know we will be back and hopefully set roots. We lucked out by going when the message was about acceptance and partiality and boy did I feel welcome! Everyone was super nice, the music was amazing and the message sealed the deal for us! Can't wait to see where God takes us in our new home and am looking forward to plugging into the community. Definitely recommend this church to anyone I know in the area!
