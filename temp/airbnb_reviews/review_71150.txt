Walking down Whyte Avenue on this hot day I saw the blue What's the Scoop location and it drew me in like a beacon of ice cream awesomeness. That may be a little fluffy but when you like ice cream as much as I do, it was the perfect time to stumble upon What's the Scoop.

Like me, you've probably walked past it dozens of time but never ventured up the few steps to the open window to make a selection.

I stood there for at least a minute, trying to decide from the dozens of flavours (seriously, how can you choose!) until a man and his son came up behind me. I heard the dad tell his son he was going to have Salted Caramel so I choose that as well - decision made!

You have the choice of cone or cup - and can choose from a "normal" cone or a waffle cone.I went with normal and was impressed by how much ice cream they could fit on and in the cone. For $4.50, it was a nice treat!

At the time I visited there were two people working, which means you got your ice cream super fast. The ice cream did melt fairly fast, even though I fancy myself as a strategic ice cream eater to prevent drips, but it is a smoking hot day today. 

While I would have loved to stay and sit in one of the many chairs with tables on the deck and just people watch, I choose to keep walking. I can see how it could be a great place to bring the family, or a date (or yourself!) for a nice treat and relaxing seat.
