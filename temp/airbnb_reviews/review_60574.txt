Truth be told, I felt like I was cheating with my favorite place (Cafe Diem) for a quick meal just two doors down... 
After another quick look down 8th St, I made my way into Cafe Thanh Truc... I hadn't had a banh mi in a long time, and felt that this was a safe bet after reading Gerald S review...
A small, but not cramped space inside with about 6-7 small tables. I took a seat and placed my order, summer rolls, grilled pork banh mi, and a glass of green ice tea.. 
The kid who took my order, (I consider everybody that appears to be 30 and under a kid.. my envy!), was very polite while not rushing the order.
The order took longer than most places to come out. But I was fine with that, considering that I've been to places that had premade summer rolls and banh mi we're just ok. 
Both came out and I was completely satisfied.. 
I probably should've followed my initial instict to not try the fresh chili paste that was in a jar on the table... That stuff was extremely hot. But I will be using it the next time I'm in and order a bowl of pho... 
Good first visit. Decent service, not rushed to order or hurried to vacate the table, and the food was great... 
Now I have another option on the same block when I'm in the area and hungry.
