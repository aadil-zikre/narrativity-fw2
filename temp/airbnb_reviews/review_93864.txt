***Note: The Ranstead Barber Shop has moved to a new location.  Lou can now be found at 42 South 19th Street  (between Market and Chesnut) in a shop that is much more easily found***

The crew at the Ranstead Barber Shop gives a great no-nonsense haircut for a totally reasonable price; Lou is my go-to guy.

I've gotten to be friends with Lou since moving to Philadelphia in August, and the more I know about him, the more I enjoy getting my hair cut.  It feels like I'm catching up with one of my dad's friends when I'm sitting in the chair.

Bonus points for the fact that Lou is childhood buddies with Philadelphia hero Bobby Rydell and recently brought Bobby back to Philly to play a benefit with his band (http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20080217_A_South_Philly_night_to_remember.html).

Additional bonus points for the fact that Lou cuts Cardinal Rigali's hair.

The shop is a bit hidden on Ranstead Street, but just follow the red, blue and white painted poles down the street to the shop's front door-- it's well worth the hunt.
