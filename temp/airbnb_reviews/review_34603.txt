It was a cold and rainy night when I entered The Common. The bright and arty space that makes up the restaurant raised my spirits.  The spirits in my fruity Pimm's cup pushed the feeling of wet coldness even further down into my subconscious. 
I was looking for comfort food and decided on the tamarind spare ribs which were prepared perfectly.  Lemon pound cake with ice cream and coffee sent me back into the darkness.
