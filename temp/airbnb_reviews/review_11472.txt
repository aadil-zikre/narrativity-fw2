On May 5th Malt House in Rockledge posted a margarita special. To help support a small business, my husband and I ordered two margaritas (strawberry and original). We placed the order at 2 and let them know we would be there around 4:30 for pickup. 

We pull in at 4:15 and waited for 28 minutes for someone to come out to our car (they were only doing curbside). Finally after two or three cars who have pulled up after us got their orders and pulled away we grabbed the next server that came out to let her know that we were there. We said "excuse me" and she goes "yeah, whats up?" like were friends or something... we say we just wanted to let you know we were waiting here and no one has come to our car yet. She responds " yeah and this is my system so you'll have to wait" we reply " thats great customer service" and she comes over to our car and screams "I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE"- oh i forgot to mention that I had my TWO year and my FOUR year old kids in the back seat while she cursed at me. Finally my husband calmed me down and another server brought out our order. 

Then i call the restaurant to talk to the manager and the phone is off the hook for over 2 hours so i called the Port Richmond location and talk to one of the girls and told her what just happened. She said OMG that is so not ok- I'm going to text my manager now you should get a call back by the end of the night....not one but TWO DAYS GOES BY AND NO CALL.

Finally, the owner MATT just called me and said "hmm ok- i'll look into it" never asked my name, what kind of car I had, what my order was... how was he to know what he was looking for? So I told him, this is not how I thought this conversation was going to go but now I know why your servers act like that. Then that MF says oh you sound like a typically philly girl- sounds like you were the problem from the start. 

HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT IT WAS MY FAULT. WE WAITED QUIETLY FOR 28 MINUTES. THEN A SERVER CURSES IN MY FACE AND ITS MY FAULT? YOU ARE A TERRIBLE BUSINESS AND I WOULD NEVER EVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN. THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND  SUPPORT A SMALL BUSINESS.
