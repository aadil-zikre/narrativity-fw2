When you go down the line look division underdogs divisional underdogs and week one constantly have a Eight record , so , you know to me that 's kind of where everything starts and ends and when those lines are very much flipped again. We saw this with Tennessee. We saw this just about everywhere Washington just squeaking inside the number. So the Green Bay one was the biggest kind of head-scratcher to me and just making some of these , you know divisional underdogs that do so well in Weak ones , you know , some of these being very long favorites like the Vikings in Washington game. Yeah. We 're going to talk about the differences from this week , especially because I mean , look I Was preparing for the show and earlier today just a few hours ago. I Sort of a list of what the consensus numbers were and they 've already moved some of them pretty significantly. So we 're going to talk about each game here and both the spreads and over/unders that we 're going to be talking about. Now that is an aggregation of the odds that are available in the market and as I mentioned last week , well , these numbers are probably what you 're going to find generally speaking. There are occasionally pretty significant differences in the odds available in the market , for example with the Bears and the Broncos right now and some of this is due to the fact that that were recording this on Monday night. The Broncos have n't played yet. So this could move but you 've got FanDuel with the Bears at minus two and a half almost every other book has them at plus one
