Was on a quest for souvenirs when I came across this shop off Whyte Ave. The name itself sparked my curiosity and when I stepped inside, it was filled with odds and ends, obscure little gifts and a whole lot of Christmas cheer. I was currently on the hunt for an ornament for Jaime cause we collect those things when we travel to new places so I thought this would be a good start.

Unfortunately they didn't have any that were Edmonton specific, but they did give me some great recommendations on where I might find one. They even showed me some of the other Canadian branded goods they carried in case there was something else I might want to take home. Nothing caught my eye, but I definitely appreciated the warm customer service. Nobody was pushy and they let all their customers gawk and handle the items on their own.

This would be a place I'd stop for a unique gift for someone if I didn't know what to get. They have a little bit of everything from seasonal picks, home goods, gag type gifts and stuff to spruce up your house or workspace. A lot of the stuff seems to be geared to women, but I imagine that tends to be their main clientele anyways.

Worth a browse, it's fun nonetheless.
