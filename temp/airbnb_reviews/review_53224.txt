Located at 3216 Little Road is Craft Street Kitchen Trinity, tucked away in the back corner of a shopping center in the NPR (New Port Richey) here you will receive amazing food and great hospitality.

My favorites are the Short Rib Sweet Potato Tots (Thai Chili Braised Short Rib, Sweet Potato Tots, Green Onion, Red Peppers, Garlic Aioli), Nashville hot chicken sliders and the Skillet Cornbread.

Thursday nights are ladies night, Sundays are Hospitality Night: 25% Off 8pm until closing time.

Go and give them a try the food is delicious and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is very modern,  the manager and server names escapes me right now (sorry) but server was super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks - The extra service goes along way and was truly appreciated. Wait I think Cody was the server's name :)
