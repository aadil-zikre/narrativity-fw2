A little less then a year ago we moved to the East Falls area and when I saw the groupon for Metric I decided it was time to switch to a salon closer to where we now live. 

Patrick cut my hair and I was very happy with the experience he was friendly, professional, and I really felt like he listened when I explained how I wanted my hair cut.  I've been growing my hair out so I really just went in for a basic all around trim and reshaping. So I didn't ask for anything complicated, but he got my bangs exactly how I like them and again did exactly what I asked for with the trim. 

The only drawback to the overall experience would be that while I was waiting for my cut I overheard another customer being told that they only accept tips in cash and won't put them on a card.  Since I had planned to tip in cash this wasn't a problem for me, but I do wish this had been mentioned over the phone when I made my appointment since I was a new customer. I would have felt really badly if I had planned to put it all on my card and not had an appropriate amount of cash, since I don't always carry cash.
