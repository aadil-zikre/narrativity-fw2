We needed our car windshield replaced after one too many commercial vehicles kicked up rocks as we drove back and forth to Bend for the last year to see and then care for an ill loved one.  Our comprehensive auto insurance has a $50 deductible that covers windshield replacement and our excellent insurance agent recommended Cascade Auto Glass for that work.  From calling Cascade to make the appointment to the guys arriving at our home right on schedule to replace the windshield to their spiffy clean up all was easy for us.   Excellent work and customer care.  Just as we would expect given they were referred by our excellent insurance agent and my finding in life's travels is excellent businesses know other excellent businesses.  

And as aside, if you are looking for great coverage of all kinds - home, auto, umbrella - and top notch agent let me know and I'll provide her name and contact info.  My husband and I have been dealing with insurance agents for over 40 years in different parts of the country as we have moved about and she is the most professional of all.
