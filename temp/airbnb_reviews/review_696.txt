We wanted to go to dinner and try something different so we came here for dinner when we walked in the door the young lady asked table for two I told her yes but I have a question to ask you are y'all still accepting Groupon I had a Groupon for a couple of months and it expired. So Groupon told me that I can go to the restaurant and just get the value I paid for it then was fine and good until we got here and the lady said no they do not accept group on any longer but she was hesitant at first but to me they should have just let us enjoy the Groupon value because it was not a soul in the building please stay would have got a profit that night. So now I had to call Groupon to figure out how I'm going to get my money back or can I cash it in for another restaurant. But I definitely will not be coming back here to eat.
