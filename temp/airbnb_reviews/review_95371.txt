My daughter did the 6 hour behind the wheel training with Blue Bell. Her instructor, Bill, was outstanding. By the time her test date arrived, she was familiar with the driving test course and had learned some tips on what to expect. Bill even gave her an information page that he had created with points to remember, and step-by-step instructions for the parallel parking. My daughter passed her test on the first try, and I give Blue Bell and Bill's teaching skills most of the credit! I would recommend this school and this instructor and intend to do this same course for my younger child when she is learning to drive.
