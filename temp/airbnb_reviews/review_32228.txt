My daughter and son-in-law were looking to get their basement completely redone by Woods.  The salesman walked them through their basement offering ideas and ensuring he knew exactly what they wanted.  He was conscious of their price point and suggested they purchase cabinets and flooring on their own to drive down that middle-man cost.  That same day they agreed to a price - but he seemed to really ball park prices in the system.  For example, as he was entering an item into the system (i.e. sump pump and drainage tile) he would use different wording that made the item seem vague, then just picked a price (i.e $3500).  That's how it worked for every item.... fire safe door, $1000... remove closet, $1600... and so on.  The total amount was very high, given that the flooring, cabinets, sink, and countertops were not included.  It was difficult to know if those price points were accurate.

When the actual workers came to walk through the house, they were aware of maybe 50% of the work the salesman promised.  They contacted the salesman who blamed it on the new project manager, but it didn't seem like that was the case.  As the workers walked through and said what they could and couldn't do, the salesman ended up tacking on additional costs for items they already thought were in the purchase price.  What could have been a $20k basement redo was looking more like $35k.  Since questioning and cancelling the work, the salesman has not responded and had in fact charged approximately $10,000 on the loan my daughter and son-in-law took out for the work without telling them or even having a final contract in place.  

If not for the workers being honest, they would have been screwed over royally.  They have since moved to another contractor.  I would not recommend working with this company if you're looking for people who aren't trying to win you over with sales tactics and promises that they can't keep.
