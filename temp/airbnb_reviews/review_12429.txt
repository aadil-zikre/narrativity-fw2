While I'm not a huge fan of Steak N'Shake's burgers or fries, I lvoe their desserts!  It gives the best sugar rush.  My fav menu item is the Very Berry Milk Shake (Strawberry if you didnt' know).  It comes w/ whip cream and an oreo-like wafer cookie thing that tastes sOOOOOooooooOOOo good.  Other favs include Oreo shake and the messy root beer floats.
