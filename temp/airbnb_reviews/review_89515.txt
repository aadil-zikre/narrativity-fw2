Awesome car buying experience!

We started thinking about getting a new car right after Isaac, when we realised the ground clearance on our 12 year old Corolla was woefully inadequate.

Looked at all the mid-sized SUVs, and made a list of the ones we wanted to test-drive, with the Subaru Forester at the top of the list. 

We steeled ourselves against the hard-sell, and drove onto the Bryan Subaru lot. Even before we had gotten out of our Corolla, the door was swinging open and the dealer was descending on us,

Or so we thought...

Greg turned out to be nothing more than pleasant and helpful. He took his cues from us, was self-aware and good-natured. He showed us what we had, was willing to be pretty flexiable, and made the sale. 



Painless, professional, pretty darn good car-buying experience!!
