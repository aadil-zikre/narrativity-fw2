We checked out Flying Fish's tasting room on a recent Friday before heading to dinner nearby. The location isn't super desirable as it's way down 295 without much else to visit nearby, but Flying Fish may soon become a destination in itself with the addition of some outdoor elements, on deck for later this summer.

State law requires tasting room visitors to receive an education about the beer before consumption, so we quickly learned a bit about each beer style Flying Fish creates. We wanted to try all the beers available during our visit so our group of four shared a tasting of all nine on tap. I'm pretty familiar with the regulars: Hopfish, Red Fish, Extra Pale Ale and the Exit series. The NJ 350 Anniversary Ale is available now and it's awesome. 

There is no food served in the tasting room (again, blame the state laws) but it's still worth a trip to try the suds. I'm looking forward to going back when the outdoor area is complete.
