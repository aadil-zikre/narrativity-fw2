So freaking good! I wish I lived closer to this place, I love the family atmosphere and the history behind it. Barringers is filled with old racing pictures and other items that are always fun to check out.
They also keep a great selection of games going on the tv so there is something to watch.
When the weather is nice make sure that you check out the back garden/patio area it is well maintained and if you live in Indiana you know how important it is to enjoy the nice weather while you can.
I love bloody Mary's so I always try to get one when I visit and they make them just the way I like, spicy but not runny nose spicy. 
The menu isn't massive, but that's a good thing because it speaks to the freshness, during my last visit I decided to go with the special which was a pulled pork wrap and I got some fries with it. Delicious and I certainly was not disappointed in my choice. One of my favorites and a place that I will keep coming back to.
