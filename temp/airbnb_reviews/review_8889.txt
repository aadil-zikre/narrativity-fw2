Guy at the counter was quick, super nice, and helpful.  To me that goes a long way at a rental car place.  My other criteria is I like having a choice of car within my vehicle type.  He gave me a broad selection to choose from, and recommended a Ford Edge, which suprisingly drove pretty nice.  It also had satellite radio and the Hertz-installed Navigation system, which he didn't charge me for.

The only thing that is holding me back from five stars is you really need to realize that if you return it with anything less than a full tank they will charge you approximately $7/gal to fill it up.  In fact, they actually charge you based on the number of miles you drove and they assume a ridiculously low number like 10 or 15mpg.  So, just make sure you either get the prepay gas option (i think it was like $22, return it with any amount of gas and there is no additional charge), or make sure you fill it up before you return it.
