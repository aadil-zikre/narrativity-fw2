Went to Belle Tire yesterday to get tires balanced and rotated on our Jeep Wrangler.  What a great experience, Scott was truly interested in what condition we were describing about one of our tires and said they would check it out and let us know what they thought might be the problem.  While we waited, we walked over to Sonic and grabbed a bite to eat.  When we returned, Scott described what they found with our problem tire.  They cross rotated the tires to try and reduce the thumping noise we were experiencing and explained that there was some uneven wear on the problem tire.  Scott also showed us the results of the free alignment inspection and suggested that the uneven tire wear could be a result of needing an alignment.  We opted to get the four wheel alignment with the one year warranty also while we were there.  I couldn't be happier with the results so far and will be doing a better job of keeping up with the suggested tire rotation plan.  If you visit Belle Tire in Camby, you will not be disappointed working with Scott, he was great!
