Four years later and I find myself reminiscing in the good old days of living nearby and coming to Edwardsville for dinners and falling in love with this restaurant. Also, my most recent visit got me thinking... This place deserves a 5-star bump.

First of all, even though it has been a long time since my last visit and review, I realized that my taste hasn't changed at all. I still ordered the gim rolls and jap chae during my visit this week.  I've been thinking about driving here and since I had some other business to tend to around the area, I purposely drove here at lunch time and made sure I was hungry. 

I was a little scared that through the years, something might have changed but no! Still the same delicious flavors I have come to know and love. Granted, this is really more of a Korean fusion place (no ban chan here) but the menu items they do offer are wholesome and worth the 40-minute drive.

My gim rolls and jap chae were delicious as ever! I think out of all the places I've had jap chae from, this has got to be my favorite. Please open a restaurant closer to St Louis so that I may enjoy your food at a more regular basis.
