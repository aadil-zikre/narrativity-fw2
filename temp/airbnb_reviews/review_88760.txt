I don't think the two star description of "Meh. I've experience better" is accurate since I honestly don't think I have ever experienced better.  Hertz, Enterprise, Avis, they all suck.  Rude ass employees who sole purpose is to deny all the prepaid for features we signed for and then to try to upsell us on every damn thing they can.   As other people wrote in their reviews this place is staffed with RUDE deceitful assholes who's goal is to piss you off right at the start of your vacation.  

Every car choice was filthy and damage in some way.  Our crappy Nissan Versa was the least damaged vehicle we found and it felt like it had some major alignment and or frame damage with the way it constantly tugged to the left.  When checking out we were trying to document all the damage to the car but they rudely told us they don't care and we won't be held responsible.  We ended up taking pictures of the dented doors and bumper falling off with the lady in the picture as proof of time.  Again, this piece-o-crap was the least damaged in the lot.  

In the end though the car was cheap and successfully transported me all around Missouri for a week.  As others mention the drop-off is a clusterf*#ck of confusion with no real signage but once we drove around confused for awhile we found were to go.  

FYI, there's a gas station about a block from the rental place which makes it easy to fill up the tank.  That's one thing I did appreciate was all their cars have a full tank of gas.  Bring it back not the same way though or they charge $9.99 a gallon.
