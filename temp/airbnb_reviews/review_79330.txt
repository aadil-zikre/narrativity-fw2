This company is luck I gave them two stars!  My family just moved to Tucson, and told me the reason they needed $1000 off the bat for the down payment is because we have no "ties" to Tucson.  We are just starting out on our house with a lease to rent, just started our jobs obviously because we just moved here in March, and then they want to say that they need that much money up front so that they know we are serious about getting a car from them!  Wow, that is crazy considering I have been to this place 3 times in the past month to try and get a car, and not having a car at the moment. Yeah, I am really going to skip out on my children's school, my job, and the lease on this house to keep your car and not make payments.  Well, going to a different place, what a waste of my time that I could not afford!
