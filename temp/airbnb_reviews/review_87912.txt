Made a call to Ashley, and she had a cancellation and fit me in the next day!  I saw so many pictures of her work that when I was ready, of course it was her I called!  I'm definitely a newbie when it comes to haircoloring, and I explained what I was hoping for, and she got it right away.  There wasn't a bit of hesitation when she went back to mix color, and she is METICULOUS when it comes to painting hair :) I got a mix of high and low lights all over, as well as just brightening up the overall color of my hair AND tinted my eyebrows, and covered my grays!  I walked out feeling like a million bucks and didn't have to spend a million bucks.  Ashley is really amazing and I will keep coming back.
