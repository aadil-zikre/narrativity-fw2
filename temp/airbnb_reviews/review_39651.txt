Most of the reviews of this club have been negative but maybe only people write reviews when they've had a bad experiene? My husband and I went on a Saturday night and had an awesome time. Sure, we spent a grip of money and I agree that the cover charge is excessive but the dancers were all very friendly which they should be if they're getting paid. I thought that the girls looked great and there was a variety... a little something for everyone!! I read another review on a different site where the guy was mad that he kept getting approached by dancers. WTF that's their job and ofcourse they're gonna try to make money and not to mention why go to a strip club if you don't want to make "friends." Overall, I had an obsolutely fantastic time and wish I knew my dancers name!!! However, there was not a lot of talking going on and I feel pretty sure I got a little extra that is not included with your standard lap dance. I'd say be prepared to drop some cash when you go and I agree with another reviewer to bring a long a girl. It seemed as if the girl patrons in the club were getting a lot of VIP attention. Oh I should mention that my husband was treated fantasticly and the girls were cool to ask me first before they gave him a dance. Not that I cared but appreciated the consideration. The only reason I'm giving it three stars is for the expense.
