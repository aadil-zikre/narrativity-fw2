It's within walking distance of my parents place, and with decent drinks, its a keeper in my book.  The patio offers a nice view of the gulf, food is decent (i'm not a fan of wings, but everyone who has had them there say good things), prices reasonable.  There aren't many options in the tiny area of pass a grille, but this is probably one of the best (service beats Hurricanes).  And if you ever care to learn what "brass monkey" actually is, it's on the menu.  I'll leave that nugget of information for you to find out yourself!
