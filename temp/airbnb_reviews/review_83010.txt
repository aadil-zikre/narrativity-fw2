I looked to see if there was a Starbucks on the way to my friend's house, and this one came up as being on-my-route. I pulled into the parking lot and struggled to find a spot (there's a bunch of other stores in the same strip mall - like a Giant). I thought to myself that the parking situation was probably an indicator of how busy they were inside the store, so I put in a mobile order instead (to avoid the line).

By the time I walked out of my car and into the restaurant my order was already completed and ready for pick-up. I was beyond impressed with their speed and will definitely be stopping here every time I go visit my friend!
