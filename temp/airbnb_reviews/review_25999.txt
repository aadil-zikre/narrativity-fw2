Started service a few months ago and decided to move to the "budget" plan so every month's bill is the same.  The service rep worked with me to explain the forecast, she listened to what I had to say about my own anticipated activities, then I suggested the final number and she agreed.  The next bill picked up the change and everything went through without a hitch.  Solid experience.
