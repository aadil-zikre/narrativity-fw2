I read other reviews online and they seemed to follow the same general description, "if you can make it past the bar, the food is excellent" 
Admittedly the bar crowd can get a bit rough but that's how they enjoy it, don't mistake the gville as a doylestown hot spot, but some place that you can go in grab a good beer and get great service. All bartenders are very nice and the food is excellent, don't worry you can choose to eat in the dinning room which is much quieter. 

With the area changing so quickly, this is a place which has the children of those locals that were here 30 years ago. And hopefully it will remain this way, yet everyone is welcome. One place I am sure to visit and grab a beer when I come home to the East Coast
