Stopped in for FRIED CATFISH for my granny; because it's FRIED FISH FRIDAY, ya know. 

I stopped in Fiorella's because the neighboring restaurant that I was initially headed to was closed at 2p, everyday, hmmmm... AnyWHO, I made my way in & as I opened the door, I could smell FRIED FOODS cooking; BINGO, I was back in the FRIED FISH FRIDAY game. 

The young lady took my order & I was NOW in line to play the 'waiting game'. After paying for my food & having a seat, I noticed patrons that entered to dine in came in AFTER me, placed ordered AFTER me & received their food BEFORE me; ehhhhhhh not cool, but I patiently waited, after all, I was winning in the FriedFishFriday game, despite losing in the 'waiting game'. 

Once my name was called & was presented with food, I exited & took note of the ability to call in an order; maybe I'll try that next time go ro
