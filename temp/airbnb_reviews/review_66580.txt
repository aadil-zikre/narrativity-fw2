My first visit to Lovers & Madmen was quite a while back (March of 2010, actually). I loved the name and the fact that re-runs of The Muppets were playing on the TV. I didn't love the coffee, this I distinctly remember. 

Fast forward a couple years and I found myself at Lovers & Madmen again for a meeting. It was super hot outside on the day of my visit, and I walked into the cafe and immediately realized that there was no AC flowing. Worse, the open windows weren't getting any breeze at all, and the huge front window seemed to serve only as a magnifying glass to the sun. With no available tables, I sat on one of the shoddy, sunken couches and felt my body heat rise. 

My cup of coffee was from the end of a pot, so there were little dregs of beans floating about my cup. The barista offered to top me off before I left, since I had only received about 3/4 of a pour, but I passed. I'm not sure what type of coffee they brew, but I'm not a fan.
