When trying to order over the phone we were told they were closing soon, but they weren't closing for another 45 minutes and then proceeded to tell us they were busy. We asked what that meant and she said well I guess nothing. When getting there to pick up our salads our rolls were dropped on the floor and they said well you might as well throw them away, hoping that was the only consideration. We asked for an extra butter and were told they were running low, so unsure about that response. They were talking about boxes of things around that are older than they are, doesn't seem like conversations that should be happening in front of customers. Truly disappointed with service this visit.
