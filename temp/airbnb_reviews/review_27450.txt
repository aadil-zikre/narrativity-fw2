Awesome is an over used word.  But what Farmers Market manager and team have managed to implement and do flawlessly every week to continue to connect people to local food during covid19 times is truly awesome.  Yelp HQ issued Thankful Thursday call out to Yelp Elites to post on pages of businesses for which we have been thankful during covid19 weeks.  For me that includes the Boise Farmers Market manager, Tamara Cameron, and her team of volunteers and farmers and producers who were determined, innovative, and nimble to pivot when state 'shut down' directives for public health and safety made opening the outdoor weekly (Saturdays) farmers market impossible.  This team crafted a smart plan for a well executed option to continue to connect people and local food and launch the Farmers Market as drive up for covid19 safe function.  

INCREDIBLY NIMBLE & INNOVATIVE COVID19 RESPONSE:  You will have the best chance to learn how Tamara Cameron's determination to make this work, the plan she developed and the people who helped make this reality by watching a Idaho Public Television interview with Tamara as linked here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBtqSgWin18

IN A NUTSHELL FOR HOW THIS WORKS: 

*Register at the BFM site and then you'll be able to reserve your pick up time (Tuesdays is the 'go' day for reservations for Saturday pick up and you'll need to move quickly to reserve because Saturday times have been all reserved well in advance in spite of the great team being able to grow from taking 400 orders to 800 orders for pick up between early morning and 1p).

*Then you'll use the simple to follow interface to order from the farmers and producers for the items of your choice, the order will be confirmed - you'll use credit card to pay for it in advance too so pick up is contact free.

*On day of pick up, arrive at the FM pick up lot at your designated time, hold up  sign to the window showing name and assigned time and in a finger snap a volunteer will put the order in your open trunk / suv back, and off you go.

WHY I'VE LOVED THIS MARKET FOR 7 YEARS:  I first started shopping at the BFM when they had a location at 10th & Grove in downtown Boise in 2013 when I was a visitor thinking about a move to Boise.  A good Farmers Market that is also accessible to me - I have had multiple sclerosis since my college years - is always high on the "necessary" list for all of the many places I've moved to since my 20's.  And as good as I thought the Boise market was then (my 2013 review saying same disappeared as did my 2014 follow up after I moved to Boise), it has been made even better with the move to their new location.  And now this year that they have managed to continue it with safe, contact free ordering for all people in respect for the Governor's public health order and mindful of safety for volunteers and shoppers has been particularly applause worthy.

WHY I'M EVEN MORE GRATEFUL NOW:  I always shop local for use at home, always have for 30 years, and I am a dedicated home cook. (Cooking keeps me sane.) And this drive up design makes it possible for me to do even in Covid19 times when I am among the demographic that needs to avoid crowds.  I hope when the market is able to open again as outdoor public space they will consider a shopping service for "pick up market side" for those of us who are being advised by the science community to avoid that community activity for a few months longer.
