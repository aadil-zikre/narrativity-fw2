(Srry for all the gross photos in advance) I have NEVER left a review of an establishment before but I feel as if this is important for anyone deciding between places to get a piercing. Go somewhere else! The piercer and staff were friendly. Unfortunately, the piercer seemed to be inexperienced and the jewelry that he had placed in my cartilage left me with an infection that has gone on for months ( I had multiple piercings done on both ears all of them got infected and would flare up on and off  for months) The piercer also gave us incorrect information on the aftercare for our piercings. He had told us to clean them with contact solution (which contains saline in it but is not to be used to clean piercings) he also told us to rotate and push the newly pierced jewelry in and out as we were cleaning them which I quickly learned from research that is a big no no since it disturbs the healing process immensely. Following his aftercare advice left my ears red, swollen, and incredibly painful. I also believe my jewelry was not the best quality or the right length bc my posts only had a tiny space between my ear and the backing. I also lost 3 pieces of jewelry bc they easily fell out while I was at work. I believe the shop is a good environment and had friendly staff. I tipped the piercer well bc of this but they have a lot to work on with their piercing services and the quality of their jewelry since I had such a bad reaction to the jewelry it is highly likely for others to have to same effect. I was also not allowed to pick out my jewelry which I have heard at most professional piercing studios you are allowed to choose what will be put in your body.
