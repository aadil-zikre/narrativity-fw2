Incredible wine, food and service! I loved the macaroni pasta with pork sugo, the eggplant meatballs, and the incredible desserts.  I'm not even a dessert person, but the almond cheesecake with black truffles was unbelievably good and surprising.  Also the pistachio gelato with olive oil and sea salt was brilliant.
