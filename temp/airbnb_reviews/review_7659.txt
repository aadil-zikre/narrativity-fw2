TrueRunner is my favorite running store.  They really bring back the customer service aspect I think a lot of companies/stores lack these days.  I originally purchased a pair of Saucony's from them that ended up not being my favorite shoe, and they replaced the shoe with no question.  Dave Ames helped me, and he was incredibly knowledgable of what I should be looking for in a shoe.  I found out with his help that I actually do have a bit of an arch, and that I need to be looking for a shoe to help me not be a heel striker.  He recommended Newtons, but also brought out a few other brands and options for me to try.  Although I decided on the most expensive pair, I didn't feel pressured to get the pair because of the other options he provided.  Also, he informed me that Newtons are good for about 900 miles, so ends up being worth the cost (not to mention when you buy Newtons you're buying the best research has to offer in running shoes).

Also, I have had trouble finding a running hat, as every one I try on looks funny and seems to have a weird fit.  Dave recommended I try the men's style running hats, and viola, perfect.  

Big THANK YOU to TrueRunner and Dave!  I will definitely be back for my future running purchases and will spread the word.
