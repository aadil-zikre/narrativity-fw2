Let me start this one off by saying I don't shop lululemon regularly as I believe the stuff is far too expensive. My dear cousin however worships the hangers her lululemon hoodies rest upon in her closet so I sucked it up and walked in in an effort to find her the perfect birthday gift.

I walked in the store and proceeded to smile and make eye contact with an associate who was walking towards me but you could imagine my surprise when she walked right past me to greet and offer assistance to two other women who were just coming in the door behind me.

After making such an "awesome" first impression I decided it would be in my best interest to seek out a gift on my own. While walking around the store not once did someone stop what they were doing to offer assistance and 2 out of 3 times what they were doing was chatting with other associates. I think it's great to have a good relationship with your coworkers but when the store is as busy as it was that day you need to spread out and circulate among customers to have the best chance of making every one of them a sale.

I have gone through all the other reviews for this store and I won't argue that the stuff is good quality but when you see something like a $23.00 water bottle one needs to admit that some of the markup from this stuff comes from the fact it is a trendy brand name. I would also strongly advise thoroughly reading the care instructions for your lululemon clothing as I can say from years of working at a thrift store the number one brand name we had donated was lululemon from people who did not follow instructions and ended up with shrunken pilled up clothing.

I think the store is great for those who fit the look that the brand wants to convey but for someone like myself $98.00 flyaway cardigans are not realistic for my lifestyle or personal beliefs.
