Came in to this salon because I was given a gift card that I needed to use. I sat down with Chantell and she was so friendly, she talked a lot and made the appointment fast. 

I ended up getting a hair cut and style, and I walked out feeling like a million bucks. I was loving the cut and style and it made me feel beautiful. 

I loved this salon so much, this is now my go to salon for all my future hair needs. I would highly recommend this salon if you want a great cut and nice style.
