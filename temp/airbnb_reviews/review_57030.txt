Was in NOLA back in February 2016 for the LSBA Small Firm conference and first day in arrived late afternoon and just didn't feel like trekking out and about cause the hotel this place is located in was so huge (Hyatt Regency)...

Wandered around and noticed this place as an in-house option...thought I'd try it out...Bad Idea! The sign at the entrance said Seat Yourself...I did and was then promptly ignored by 3 different servers...and the place was sparsely populated

Guess I wasn't packing the right equipment to catch attention...I say that because shortly after I was passed by for the 3rd time a group of honeys walked in, probably from the Watermelon Convention, and they pretty much needed lion tamer's equipment to keep the waiters at bay...

So I thought "F" this and moved to the bar...wasn't any better there...especially after I told the barkeep I just wanted a water to drink...finally get an order placed and when it came out the barkeep service was just short of flinging the plate down on the bar...

Now let's get to this crappy overpriced burger...the bun was stiff like it was over toasted but fell apart like it was stale...also it was billed as a "Gourmet" burger and I've found that means it don't come with diddly but meat and a bun...no pickles, no onions, no lettuce...asked the bar staff about that, at this point as politely as I could muster, and you'd have thought I'd just landed from Mars...they end up bringing me a bowl with some stuff that looked like kimche(?)...

The patty itself was cooked decently so that was a pleasant surprise but the fries were burnt...all in all wasn't worth the $20 it cost me and honestly if I want to be treated like dog shit on a hot sidewalk and served a terribly cooked meal I'll simply call my ex-wife up and see if she'll invite me over for supper...
