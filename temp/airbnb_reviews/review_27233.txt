I've been taking lessons and enjoying the open dance nights at NDC Belle Meade for almost two years now. The instructors are fantastic and the curriculum can be molded to the newest of dancers AND those that have some background. 

Dancing makes me feel alive and any bad day I'm having is made better once I step out of the dance floor. My instructors, Kayla and DeShawn, have worked closely with me on pulling me out of my 'shell'. I can't thank them enough for making me feel like a pretty princess during the Waltz or a vixen during the Rumba. 

If you can walk forward, backward and side to side, you can learn to dance too! Thanks NDC for countless evenings of fun, excitement and relaxation!!
