Had a tech (the owner) of Air Done Right come to my house to see why my AC unit was not getting cold... He tells me I'm out of coolant... Said he filled it and my home should be cool within a few hours... Few hours later my home still was not cold or cooler...called them back the next day to inform them that it's still not cold... Said they will put me on the schedule for a return visit... Took two weeks for them to come back... Tech(owner) said he did a series of test and long story short said that I need a bigger unit the one I had wasn't big enough to cool my house...even though it's cooled my house with no problem in the past... He quoted me a price for new unit and left...I called Meenan the next day to get a second opinion... Tech from Meenan came out said my unit was empty which was weird because Air Done Right just filled it up...Meenan filled my unit and it got cold right away and my home was cold within  2 hrs...and has been cold ever since....which bring me to the conclusion that Air Done Right couldn't have filled my unit like he said and have me pay for a service that was not render...I would never use them or recommend them to anyone
