Ever heard of off gassing? Neither had I until we entered the market for a new bed! Apparently new mattresses are a major culprit of this process sending lots of harmful chemicals into the air in our home! Now I'm a total skeptic when it comes to this kind of all natural stuff, but this seemed legit, and if it makes the fiancee happy, I'm all in too, even if it costs an extra arm and leg. So off to the Sleep Shop we went, as it's the only place in town to get an all natural, or even organic bedding! 

When we walked in, we were greeted by the soothing sounds of falling rain, chirping birds, and I immediately knew I was not in Kansas anymore. The high desert became the canopy of a calming rainforest filled with giant pillowy plush clouds, also known as mattresses. Our guide through this fantasy land was Karen, a total sweetheart who'd been selling bedding for many years. She knew more about mattresses than I thought anyone could, and her approach to a sale was fantastic. She was not pushy, stressing the health benefits of such a purchase or even pushing us toward the most expensive, all natural options available. She said comfort first, and that's where we landed. 

The experience was relaxing and fun, and we left educated and very comfortable with our decision to drop some major coinage on this new bed, bed frame, pillows, and sheets, all made from non-gassing and some organic materials. Thanks to Karen and the sleep shop, I'll be living it up in a new king size bed soon, and I'll finally have room to spread out the way I like!
