Hi everyone, this is from a 23 year old male perspective.  I've been here three or four times for a hair cut and every time except once I was pretty much rushed out of there.  I have been getting bad haircuts ever since I can remember so I bring pictures and I describe what I want done with my side-burns and back of the head.  

The person who cut my hair the last time I went, Allison, didn't really care about my picture I brought, she took a peek and was oh, I know what to do.  Turned out awful, her attitude was the typical "I can't wait for this guy to leave."  

In the end, she cut the top and back of my hair the same length and the sides nearly the same length then took her scissors with teeth and chopped all my hair up... almost typical haircut guys will get when they get a haircut, even when that's not what they ask for.  The whole thing probably took around 15 minutes and I really felt unwelcome.

The cost for men is around 25 dollars, give or take 3 dollars.
