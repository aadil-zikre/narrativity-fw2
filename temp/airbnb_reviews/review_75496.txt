I've been a Patco user for many years now and figured that it's about time that I put in my two sense. I will both agree and disagree with many other reviews and will also outline what I feel can be the best possible Patco experience one can have. 

Pros: 
-Patco Freedom Card (can easily be loaded using the machines at the stations or online or have your balance checked)
-Train comes every few minutes during peak times (M-F mornings and evenings)
-Easy access to Rutgers University, Cooper Hospital, Camden City Hall as well as Old City and Center City Philadelphia 
-A good idea if you plan on partying in the city (I usually store the late night times in my phone so that I don't end up waiting a long time for a train late at night)
-A train fare to Philly is close to $6. A bridge toll alone is $5, which does not include driving around aimlessly to find a spot, paying for parking or gas 
-You can go online and check their schedule as well as "special schedule" when they are doing trackwork 
-Parking in Philly can be a royal pain in the ass and Patco is a nice alternative 

Cons:
-During off peak hours they are ALWAYS doing trackwork (I used to go to Rutgers and would sometimes miss the train at night because I had the scheduled train times but they would be off due to trackwork
-You can only load a minimum of $20 onto your Patco card and you cannot pay for a single or round trip ticket using a credit or debit card (You must have cash)
-The train only comes every 40 minutes during the night on weekends so plan accordingly! 
-Compared to some other trains I've been on in major cities (Boston & NYC), they are a bit outdated meaning they have yet to embrace the digital age (some electronic signs with updated train times would be nice) and the cars are exactly as they appear to be, which is 40 years old 
-Patco employees need to issue tickets to cars that take up more than one spot (depending on which station you go to, but I find this common at Lindenwold)

I have been to almost every station on the Jersey side during almost any time of the day at some point and here is my take on them...

Lindenwold-A bit shady, impossible to find parking that isn't a 10 minute walk during the week between the hours of 9AM and 2PM, spots are tight, people take up two spots (which also always seem to be much closer to the entrance), You're much better off driving the extra 5 mins to Ashland 

Ashland-clean, safe, ample parking, before 10AM you must pay $1 to park in the main lot ( a small fee compared to the stress you save v Lindenwold station), but you must also have a Freedom card in order to do this 

Woodcrest (good if you'e coming from Rt. 295, no complaints), Haddonfield (no complaints), Westmont & Collingswood (parking can be tight during peak hours but no other complaints), Ferry Ave, Broadway, City Hall (have never driven to any of these but Broadway and City Hall provide easy access to landmarks in Camden)
