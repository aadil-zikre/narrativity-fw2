Went to school in Kennett a couple years back and am happy to see all the new food options downtown when I come home to visit my parents. Had a burger here with my friend, which came out really quickly and was great. Sat and chatted with my friend for a while and didn't feel rushed out of the place. Seems like it would be a great spot to come for lunch. One of the owner's stopped by our table to make sure the meal was okay. 

Will definitely be returning!
