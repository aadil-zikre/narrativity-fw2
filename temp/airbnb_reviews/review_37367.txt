I wish I would have checked the reviews for other Rooms to Go locations on Yelp before purchasing a mattress at this location.  The salesman was friendly and helpful enough, but the delivery company provides the worst customer "dis-service" I have ever had experience with.  

First, I received a text message the night before my delivery with a four-hour window for the next day.  The delivery company will not give you any further advance notice than 24 hours, which can be problematic if you need to take time off of work to be home for the delivery, which I did.  They told me my delivery window would be from 0700-1100.  At 1030 I called the delivery number to see if my delivery would still be on time.  The customer service rep laughed and said, "No, haha, your drivers got a late start this morning!".  I asked if they would be arriving shortly after 1100.  She then replied, "your new window for delivery today is 1100-1500."  I told her I only took a half day off of work based on my original delivery window, but she was unwilling to provide me with a narrower delivery window than 4 hours.  Ridiculous.  I asked if they could call me when the delivery driver was about 30 minutes out, so I could come back home from work and receive the delivery.  The rep replied that I could call when I got home and they would let me know if the delivery truck was still in the area and if they would have "time" to deliver the mattress.  I explained that I would be home at 1700, but to that I received the reply, "no way, we stop working at 5!"  (So I guess getting a late start is perfectly acceptable, but working late is totally not.)  

I called the store to explain my concerns, but they told me it was out of their hands and I had to work it out with the delivery company.  Again, ridiculous.  It is now 3 weeks later, and still no mattress.  Please save yourself the trouble and do not purchase from Rooms to Go, as I had to learn that lesson the hard way.
