I would not recommend.  I'll preface this by saying I only had chicken(I don't eat beef or pork). The chicken and smoked wings were very dry they need sauce. The baked beans were very dry. The greens were from a can and the corn bread was not homemade.  The sweet potato wedges were inedible. The pulled chicken sandwich was ok.
