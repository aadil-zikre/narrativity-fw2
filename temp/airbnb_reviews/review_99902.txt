The front desk staff was SO RUDE that we walked out and went somewhere else.

We went near the end of the day and they clearly didn't want us to sign in. Although there were no cars out front and only one person in the waiting room they quickly told us the wait was over an hour and we were best off to go to their other location in St. Peters. I said we'd wait knowing it wouldn't be an hour and they insisted that I go to St. Peters saying "it's only a few minutes from here" well it's not actually it's about a half hour drive... they have no clue where their locations are. Even when we tried to sign in and wait they were very rude and since it was my son who was being seen I was afraid he would have an awful experience so we left and went the the place down the street that saw us immediately and was very friendly.
