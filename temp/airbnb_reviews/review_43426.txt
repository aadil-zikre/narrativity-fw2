I am thrilled with my experience with Millennium Flowers this week! I've ordered flowers for delivery a handful of times and I never remember the places I order from; I realize now that must be indicative of a so-so experience. Well, not anymore. I've found my go-to shop! 

After checking out a handful of flower shop pages on Yelp, I kept coming back to Millenium - I loved the arrangement photos posted by other Yelpers - especially the one posted by Maria L. On the website, arrangements looked nice, though a bit outdated, so I called the shop to articulate exactly what I wanted. That's when I was connected with Yana, who went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my order. 

Yana explained that they have a great designer in-house and she was able to work with me on my price point. Today, I was pleasantly surprised when she sent me several pictures of the finished arrangement via text. She wanted to confirm that I was happy before the flowers went out for delivery. This has never happened before and I thought it was such a nice touch. As you can see from the photos, the flowers are gorgeous. Most importantly, my mom, who is retiring on Friday, absolutely loved them!
