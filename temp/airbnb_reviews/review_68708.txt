Conveniently located about 5-7 minutes away from the airport, this Enterprise was one of the better rental car experiences I've had. It only took a few minutes to book the rental online and they called a day ahead to confirm my reservation as well as let us know what documents would be required to secure the rental.

Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and promptly provided keys. Trey assisted us with picking up and inspecting the rental vehicle upon return. He was so pleasant, polite, knowledgeable, and eager to assist. He was our first impression of Southern hospitality and really got our vacation off to a great start. I liked that after returning the vehicle, we were asked if we needed a ride anywhere and they were so kind as to deliver us back to the airport. Trey also asked how we felt about their customer service before we left which I found to be a nice touch from Enterprise.

I would have given 5 stars but the vehicle we rented was pretty dirty / in need of a wash on the exterior , although the interior was clean and it had a 14 inch crack in the driver's side of the front windshield which Trey asked  whether would be too distracting to drive. While I appreciated him acknowledging the giant crack and gaining manager approval to offer a discount because of it, I don't think a vehicle with such a huge crack in the windshield should remain part of rental inventory at all. On this day, it was also the only available vehicle of its class and capacity so we went with it.
