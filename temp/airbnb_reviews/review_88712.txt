I will give this salon two stars because in the past I have really liked my nails but after the HORRIBLE customer service I received this past week I am never going there again.  I made an appointment and when I arrived the nail tech had taken a walk in five minutes before my appointment time.  When I asked about my appointment she didn't even raise her head to look me in the eyes and give me an answer....so rude.  I ended up leaving and not having my nails done.  The bright side to this is I ended up finding another nail salon that is much much cheaper and does a MUCH better job.

And I am not even going to get into the pricing that they don't have because one person will charge you one price and someone else will charge a totally different amount which leads me to think I am being overcharged for my services.  Well they will never get my money again
