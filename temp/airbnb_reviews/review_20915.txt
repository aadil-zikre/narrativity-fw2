I ordered a buffalo chicken cheese steak along with my co-workers.  I am writing this to say that it was terrible.  The bread was good, not too hard but had a good crunch.  I expected the chicken to be shredded but it was chunks of tough, cold chicken.  Some of the meat was chewy.  I do not recommend this item.  Maybe the pizza will be better.  I pretty much spent  $7.50 for bread, and hot sauce.
