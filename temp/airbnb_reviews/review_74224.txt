The food itself is great, crispy fries and onion rings, very customizable burgers. But if you're going to get take out, do not order ahead for pickup at a later time. Might as well just order there.

I went to pick up an order I placed a few hours before. I arrived on time and didn't exactly expect my order to be ready. I told them I was here to pick up the order I placed and the girl up front said they were working on it. "Great, at least it'll be super fresh when I get it" I thought 

I waited and waited and noticed a lot of people coming and going, some who ordered before me, get their food and leave. After about 25 to 30 minutes they had my food ready.

Clearly it seems like they forgot about my order until I arrived, but what stood out the most was how inefficient the place seemed. I noticed this with what I was able to observe during my extended time there.

I get the ordering ahead was probably my fault, but maybe they shouldn't take orders ahead if they can't remember to have the food ready when the customer arrives. I'd like to think this was a one off incident, but unfortunately, I had to deal with it.

Might go back, but might just order from somewhere else if I'm too hungry to possibly wait an additional 30 minutes.
