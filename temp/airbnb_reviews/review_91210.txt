I'm only giving one star because I have to put something down. About six years ago I didn't know much about puppy mills and the types of pup that comes from them. I visited Jack's then and fell in love with Boston Terrier / Pug mix. In the six years of her being alive, she saw the doctors for two very costly maladies: luxating patella in both knees ($3K surgery per knee) and a primary malignant brain tumor (spent about $10k trying to keep her quality of life as best as possible since saving her was not possible) which led to her early passing in December of 2012. I was lucky to have my dog and, with what she went through, I know she was lucky to have me as I fought as hard as I could for her. Please do not go to Jack's Dog Farm. There are lots of dogs that need good homes on Petfinder. When I went the cages were not deplorable, it didn't smell, and I was quick to receive service but they are trying to sell you a dog for profit. It is possible that other dogs in her litter did not have these issues but luxating patellas are a genetic condition that a reputable breeder would not have overlooked. 
Now that I know better, I will always choose rescuing first. I assure you that I am not a crazy, over the top, animal person. Just trying to help someone not go through what I went through. If you want to read about our story, visit http://sophiesfight.wordpress.com/
