From my experience when I go to comic book stores, the people are always extremely friendly and helpfull, unfortunately when I walked into Temdee first of all I almost tripped over a big dog, ok.....then there was a guy at the counter that wouldn't even acknowledge me...ok...anyway I look at their inventory, it's pretty messy and unorganized from any other comic book stores that I have been to, but on the upside they do have alot of old comic books in stock.   I found 1 book that was reasonably priced, went up to the counter paid for it, didn't really get a thank you or anything kinda walked out with a feeling, that you never want to go back again.  If you want to go to nice comic book store go to "the comic book store"  or  "all things fun"
