Maybe everyone loses faith with Sweat eventually, or maybe it has actually gone downhill. But since I joined a year and a half ago, they've managed to cancel every class I went to (mostly eliminating the entire boxing program) and generally piss me of royally. 

Sure, the standard Sweat stuff for cancelling your membership applies, so I was prepared to submit my notice 60 days in advance, in writing, it is what it is.

But the way the staff here doesn't 'sweat' about members is pretty impressive -- and I do remember way back when I was a newer, happier member (and hadn't gotten on more than one treadmill where the downshift button didn't work -- THAT'S A SCARY THING), I remember one of their own staff saying "there's no point in actually maintaining the gym, all you have to do is keep enough new members coming in and it doesn't matter how you treat them, because of contracts."

Dude was telling the truth ... I really would like to believe it used to be better, but they managed to scare away at least 4 instructors that I knew, and have generally been smug punks at the desk when I have politely asked why they randomly cancelled classes at some times without informing anyone or told them about broken machines ...
