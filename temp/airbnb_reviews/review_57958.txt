Whilst driving the pot hole afflicted streets of Uptown today, I got a flat tire. Thankfully, I have AAA. Unfortunately, I was driving around without a spare. I picked Park Place Tire & Auto because it was the closest shop to my location; it's also the closest automotive repair shop to my home, so I'm glad I discovered it. Donald got me in and out of there faster than most oil change places, and he was personable and friendly. He was also reasonably priced. I'll bring my business here from now on, and will most definitely return!
