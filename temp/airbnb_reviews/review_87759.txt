I have wanted to swing by here since it opened but didn't have a chance until this afternoon. The shop is in the lovely neighborhood of Glenora and there is plenty of parking in front and even if the parking was full, there would be no trouble find street parking! 

The cafe has a decent amount of seating, and the staff were super friendly and greeted me as soon I walked in the door and before I left! This would me a nice quiet place to catch up with a friend or even take a date!

I ordered the vanilla iced coffee as it was 21 degrees today and iced anything sounded like a good idea! I watched it being prepared and was intrigued when I saw it being shaken in something like a cocktail shaker. I love that idea! Because it was shaken, the vanilla was evenly mixed and enjoyed with every sip of the ice latte...as opposed to just having the vanilla, espresso, & milk all dumped into a cup and stirred or worse, not stirred at all and having your first sip be all sugar and your last, all bitter espresso. 

There is only one size available in the iced coffee, and pricewise, it is at a bit of a premium if you compare to chain coffee shops; however, I would say it is in line with smaller coffee shops offering premium coffee produced in small batches. I have a soft spot for small batches coffee, as there is such a difference in taste. There's no bitterness and I imagine this if I were to order drip coffee or espresso, that I wouldn't need to add any sugar or milk because it would just be a disservice to the coffee. I will certainly have to visit again to try the drip coffee and pastries because on a hot day, I went the iced latte route :)
