Our A/C went out sometime yesterday evening & I called them at 8 am to get an appt for a service call. The lady who answered was so friendly & gave me a service time of 10a-12p. I decided to run some errands first thing so I could get some stuff done around the house while I waited for the serviceman to arrive.  Well, when I pulled up at 9:58, Joe was waiting on me!! He found the broken part easily (which was very clearly damaged) then waited for 15 minutes to be sure it worked before leaving. I knew it was fixed when I felt cold air coming from the vent before I even went to talk to him!  He was very professional & friendly and their rates were very reasonable (I've heard the horror stories & watched Dateline!!). My husband's practice has used McCarroll's several times & now I see why. This is my go-to heating & A/C company in Springfield!
