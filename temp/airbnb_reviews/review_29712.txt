One would think with all the ice cream shops in the area it would be very difficult to decide which one to try, I personally would try them all if that would be possible for someone traveling through the area, trust me it's not possible because there are so many, so I relied on my fellow Yelpers and boy did they get it right.

I must admit this place had another convincing physicality that reeled me in "homemade banana cream ice cream" O-M-G yes I know everyone talks about the waffle cone and trust me all of what they say is true but not for me I wanted mine piled high in a lonely cup with a spoon. I was all in after the first bite I made a lame attempt to share but she was enjoying a waffle cone filled with mocha chip and chocolate mint and had no interest, which was fine by me.

This place was immaculate, maybe even a level or two cleaner than that and if someone stood up the "sanitizer" was on her way to ensure everything was reset to perfection, of course I'm sure everyone shares this responsibility but this one little girl was all over it and it was all done with a smile. I must say the entire staff was friendly and attentive during our visit, this place is definitely a must do if you're in the area, I only wish I had found them a few days earlier but I know without a doubt I'll be back since we frequent this coast and only live a few hours away...
