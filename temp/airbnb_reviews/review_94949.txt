We were/are looking for a specific car. Know exactly what we want down to the options, etc. Put a request in via internet to test drive the car we want to purchase. The very next day received call from employee that handles internet sales. My husband asked, "Is the car that we want on the lot and ready to test drive? If we drive all the way down there want to make sure it is available". Employee promised car would be available. Drove down and guess what? Not only could they not find the car -- we did four full laps around the entire dealership looking for missing auto. After 40 minutes of looking for missing auto -- we were told that a local celebrity was driving car and not sure when it would be returning to lot? Really?!? After we specifically asked if car was available.....employee apologized for confusion, however left a bad taste in our mouth. Drove off lot and straight to Ford dealer in Wesley Chapel where we purchased car we wanted.
