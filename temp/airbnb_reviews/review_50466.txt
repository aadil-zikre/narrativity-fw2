I had my hair done by both Vera and Dafne before. I really like Vera , she is nice and really cares about her customers. 
Last time I went there, I was hoping that I could get a new hair color , I had an appointment with Dafne. The coloring was not a success, she did not cover my hair with the color I wanted so she asked me to come back again for another free service which I think was a really nice thing. 
The second time I went there, she apparently had another appointment at that time so had no time taking care of my hair ,but I thought it was alright since Vera helped me with the coloring, she left for lunch afterwards so Dafne washed my hair. 
She just pour some water on my hair, wash it a bit and use a towel to squeeze dry my hair (my hair was like 60% wet at that time)Then she took away the towel and said thank you. 
It was like "Oh, since this time was free, and I have already washed your hair, now you can leave" I was in complete shock coz my hair was wet and she didn't even bother to blow dry a bit. So I asked her to blow dry. You could tell she didn't care, she just wanted me to leave. 
After like 2 min of blow drying, she stopped and looked at me again and said  " ok, thank you" 
I really hope that I can write a positive review , sadly this experience with Dafne was really a disappointment.
