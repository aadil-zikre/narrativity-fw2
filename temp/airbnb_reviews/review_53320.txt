Some of these pictures are from walking the sidewalk along the N Gulf Blvd road but are all private areas but the rest are from the Waterfront Park. 

This is a nice area next to the to pier that takes you out through the mangroves to the water front. 

Today I had to remember the time change so almost missed it. 

It is a small area but worth the visit with great views and wildlife.
