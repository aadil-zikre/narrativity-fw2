Love Shawarma on the Go! When they first opened, we tried (and completely finished) the chicken shawarma and gyro combo plate, two gyros (whole wheat and white) with a side of fresh hummus, and the chicken tenders with its addictive dipping sauce! Their dishes are freshly prepared and the large/reasonable portions don't leave you feeling hungry ten minutes after finishing your meal. The best part is that all their dishes come at a great price, which is hard to find in this neighborhood. In the past 5 days, I have eaten at Shawarma on the Go three times and simply can't get enough!
