Very conveniently located across from Vanderbilt's campus, the CVS on 21st is a good place to stop in quick and run an errand (for me, an errand usually means a snack).  They are located in a building with a garage in the rear for the other businesses in the building, so if you can't find street parking, I'd recommend using their 1 hour parking.  There's usually an attendant monitoring the spaces, so you can't get away with leaving your car there for a longer time.

I've never used their pharmacy, but it's usually frequented by Vanderbilt students who either don't know about or don't trust Student Health on the campus (or they need s scrip filled)...this seems to be the busiest part of the store.

I try and use the self-scan at the rear of the store with the fear of screwing something up and having to wait for an employee to enter my weird coupon or non-scannable item.  This is because for whatever reason, they seem to only keep one cashier at the front and call others as backup.  Everytime I am here there seems to be an ever-growing line, so even if you're quick with your shopping, it might not be the fastest method checking out.
