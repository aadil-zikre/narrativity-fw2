I haven't flow delta in a long time, but since I have reason to go to nyc I booked with the air line, I was supposed to visit in April, but had to cancel. I don't have to tell you why. 
I was able to rebook a trip for December, thankfully delta was awesome about the whole thing, and I was able to use a credit so my flight was very cheap.
Over all I think delta is an airline that is taking safety to the next level during covid. 
They gently remind people about masks consistently which is a good thing, and they also hand you a sanitizer wipe when you walk on the plane, and since all airlines have limited snack services now, delta hands you a snack bag with more sanitizer.
Another plus is that they have inflight shows, which I was happy to have as an option, they show and movie variety was awesome, there is something for everyone. When people went to get off they asked that people let the row in front of them go and then the next row is supposed to them get up and get off. Which is a great and safe idea that most people were following. Of course some are having a hard time adjusting but delta reminded people that it is for safety and to please follow what they were asking. All around a great flight experience and they are someone I would book with again.
