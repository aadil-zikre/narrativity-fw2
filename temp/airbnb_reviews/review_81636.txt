I sustained an injury to my lower back and physical therapy was recommended. The owner came highly recommended and the convenience of close proximity to my work sealed the deal. To his credit, the owner was friendly and appeared knowledgeable while doing his assessment on me. However, the service all fell apart when he then delegated the work to his assistants-a collection of apathetic, 20 something undergrads who cared less about care than rushing though a demonstration exercise so that they can get back to their social media. The 'sweatshop' atmosphere of the therapist working with 15-20 patients simultaneously, didn't exactly put me at ease of getting hands on quality care. 

I also understood that the most important part of recovery was to do the recommended exercises prescribed by the care-provider independently. However,  the generic exercises he gave me to do at home appeared to aggravate my injuries further. When I attempted to contact the therapist by phone to ask for guidance, I was told he would get back to me ASAP. He called 2 weeks after my initial call. By then, I was already involved with MOMENTUM Physiotherapy recovering nicely(See my review). 

To sum up, my experience was awful in that instead of receiving care for my injury, I was being processed like a piece of meat going through an assembly line, where squeezing as many people into a workspace supersedes actual care.
