Being familiar with and having visited the Muncie Amazing Joe's, I was eager to see how the Indy location was going to measure up.  First off -- What a great space!  They took the old Oobatz building to a cool new level for sure.  Located just in front of the District Tap and near Drakes, I would say Amazing Joe's would be the choice over the other 2 if you are looking for good, solid food and drinks at a great price point.

I would call the fare at Amazing Joe's Steakhouse (or AJ's) "casual American"...steaks, pork chops, seafood, pasta, sandwiches, salads... good variety to please lots of preferences; straight up food - no fancy twists or ingredients you cannot pronounce.   The menu is pretty much identical to what I remember from the Muncie location, but they also run some killer deals and cool things that make it worth the trip.  

Cliff notes version:
- $2.99 12oz Margaritas on Sundays
- $9.99 early-bird menu from 4-5pm daily
- Kids eat free Mondays from 5-close and Saturdays from 11a-4p
- 2 different patios will offer outdoor seating in warmer months; one 21+ and one family friendly (being pet friendly is to be determined)
- The Frank Room is a cool space that seats 12 at a round table for special gatherings
- Friendly servers and visible management; the managing partner even stopped to chat to make sure our meal was satisfactory
- Nice wine list and full bar
- Rumor has it they may add local craft beers soon (Please!)
- Follow them on social media for killer deals!

The thing to remember is that they are still in the early stages of getting things ironed out here...but mixing in some seasoned staff from their other locations is helping the process along nicely.  Fingers crossed they are there to stay!
