I just leased a new car from Walker Acura and could not be happier. I recently moved to Louisiana from Massachusetts where I had previously leased an Acura. I had a great experience with Acura for my first lease (amazing customer service, great quality cars, and efficient service when needed), so I was hoping to stay with Acura again. My lease was about to end, so I went to Walker Acura looking to turn in one car and get another. I was introduced to Michael, who was absolutely wonderful to work with. He took lots of time to understand exactly what I was looking for, and show me all the options they had in the price range I was hoping to stay within. Michael was not pushy at all and truly seemed motivated by his customers' satisfaction. He leased me the car of my dreams (well, at least for the next three years...) for a price I was very happy with. Michael also took the time to introduce me to a number of Managers within his dealership, including the GM (Jeremy) who was just as concerned with making sure I left happy. I could not recommend everyone at Walker Acura more highly and will be sure to send anyone I know who is in the market for a new car to them. I love my new car, but I am already looking forward to my next experience with them in 2017.
