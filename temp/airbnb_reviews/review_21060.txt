Living around this area for the past 20 years I've seen the small fruit and vegetable stand grow into a little slice of country comfort store. Stopping in yesterday I purchased the most delicious fresh pasta And a fresh homemade puttanesca sauce. Also a cinnamon apple bread that was fresh and warm at four dollars a loaf not to be missed do not leave without one of these fresh bread which you will find up by the counter. Walking through the store they have delightfully fresh fruits and vegetables all incredibly reasonably priced. Along the outer walls you'll find sauces , As well as Sarah Beth's homemade jams, and other types of marinades and dips. As you walk towards the back refrigerator you will find several jars of sauces fresh made for over pasta or vegetables. Also found fabulous extra large brown farm fresh eggs back refrigerator bottom right hand side brings yourself home with a dozen or two. There is also a front refrigerated area where the fresh pasta and beef is kept. There is wonderful friendly and helpful staff always available. The parking lot is gravelly so pull in and pull up leave space for all the rest of us. And don't forget to try those boiled peanuts the Mike's pies and the other delights that they offer.
