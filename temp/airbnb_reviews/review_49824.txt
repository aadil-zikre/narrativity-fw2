Don't ever go to Jim Click Ford. The sales people are incompetent and the maintenance crew a horrible. We went in for a simple oil change yesterday and came out to a broken door today. They broke it but since we cannot "prove" it was them, they won't fix it. All I know is it was working fine prior to leaving it in their hand and now it's broke. This is not the first time we have had issues with them either.
