**UPDATE**

I was called back immediately after my yelp review and they said there was miscommunication amongst the office with the laser advert. I still think the lady who took my call should get a long time out or be replaced if this isn't her first complaint- but I really like doc Mackenzie and he deserves a 5 for his bedside manner

The check-in deal will not be redeemed for laser treatment. False advertising-The receptionist is rude and made me feel like a cheap customer- sorry if I'm a smart consumer. I give it 2 stars because dr Mackenzie and his consult specialist  are very sweet- I went for a consult before for my rhino but went with a surgeon who specialized with trans people- I have money to spend darling, and the money the office spends to hire you is a bad invest.
