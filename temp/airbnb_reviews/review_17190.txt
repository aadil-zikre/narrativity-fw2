Let me start off by saying I'm more of an Aldi or Trader Joe's gal but I was in need of some TP and bathroom necessities so I tagged along with my Costco Queen, Joanna B  it's no secret that you can get some great deals here when it comes to purchasing in bulk. However, I'd also argue that some items require closer review when it comes to "saving money". Just because you're getting eight cans of black beans doesn't always mean the price per can is cheaper than what you'd find somewhere like say, Aldi. 

I think it's something about the warehouse style vibe or that this place leaves people buying incredibly large amounts of items that they entered the store with no intent or need of buying that leaves me with love/hate thoughts. Alas, that's more on the shopper than the store ;)

I can't argue with the complimentary samples, $5 rotisserie chickens or $4 gigantic bags of fresh spinach. Overall, a fun time to time visit to stock up on the core items and purchase a few surprises along the way.
