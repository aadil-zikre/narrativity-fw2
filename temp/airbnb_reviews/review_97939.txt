Today I had a really wonderful experience with Tory.  I brought my four year old curly haired daughter in for her first real cut.  Tory was kind and patient with my daughter through out the entire process.  It truly took 2 full hours for the cut, the wash, the dry, the "fix" cut.  It was not only wonderful for my daughters hair, she left with her beautiful ringlets as they are meant to be, but she taught me how to take care of my daughter's curls...something I really needed as a straight haired mama.  I will definitely bring Ava back when it is time for another cut and I highly recommend all moms in the area to bring their curly haired girls and boys in to see Tory.  Every where I looked I saw beautiful curls and people learning how to care for and appreciate their own natural beauty.  They even took before and after photos of my daughter.  I am so thankful to have found a place to help me show my daughter how beautiful she is naturally....hopefully now as a four year old and all the way up to a fourteen year old and beyond.
