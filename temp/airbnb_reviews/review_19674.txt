We came here to get flowers for our mom around Christmastime and loved the trees and lights hanging from every surface. I can't imagine how long it took to decorate like that. We walked into the flower fridge, trying to decide what to get. Because we were a little out of our element, we asked for help and the sweet woman at the counter came and gave us a few suggestions to complete the bouquet. She wrapped up our flowers and even put a big bow on it, which made it look really beautiful. 

This place is definitely more expensive than say, your local grocery, but the flowers are huge and stunning -- something that our mom deserved after 20+ of raising us. Many of the flowers are organized individually, so you can also build a bouquet based on your price-range too. The shop sells non-flower gifts, cards, and local chocolate too, so you can get a full present for someone here. My mom loved the surprise!
