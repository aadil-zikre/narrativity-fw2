Visiting FL for family & Halloween and my bf made it a prerequisite that he gets LJS.

Pulled up to the drive thru and waited for roughly 2 minutes with no answer. I didn't see a sign stating the drive thru was out of order so unsure what their reasoning was. I probably would have waited longer so I recommended going inside.

Once inside the service was surprisingly quick & accommodating. The cashier spoke to the customers and the bf food came out quick and to his satisfaction. Although I would have rated this place a 1 because of the drive thru and never made it inside, I'm taking the bf suggestion and giving it a 3 as a compromise.  The serviced saved this experience for me although I was not eating there. 

If you're visiting this location, go inside and bypass the stress of the drive thru
