I stopped here to enjoy my coffee and breakfast bagel in a peaceful setting prior to the start of a busy day after driving a few hours from the east coast. I was very surprised to find such an expansive green space filled with aquatic plants and wildlife in the midst of the city, although I shouldn't be since this is one of the many benefits of living here in beautiful Florida. After finishing my breakfast I found I still had time to do a little exploring and took a long walk around the park. This is a beautifully managed park and it's apparent that a lot of the locals take full advantage of this, there were numerous people taking their early morning stroll on the well manicured trails and wooden boardwalk.
