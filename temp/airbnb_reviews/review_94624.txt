Coffee is decent muffins are great and everything else is amazing

* my complaint is with the Cycling idiots out front first off you have to hurdle the sea of bicycles to get to the front door and in the process you realize none of the cyclists order anything from Le Buzz. so they just sit out front and crowd up the place. Secondly be prepared to receive major attitude here not from the staff but customers they are rude and dont clean up the messes they make personally this place is great around 10:30 when all the spandex fairies have returned to their retirement communities and Subaru station wagons.

with that being said they are like a crew of spandex wearing coffee drinking shaved bikers that over run this place i think even the staff are overwhelmed .  Sorry
 le buzz get a bike rack or put up signs so people dont trip
