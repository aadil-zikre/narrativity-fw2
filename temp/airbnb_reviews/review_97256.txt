Absolutely horrible!  Had my oil changed and they didn't cap or seal something right so I had oil leaking.  After returning the car and the maintenance people admitting their fault, they said they cleaned it up and fixed it.  I drove to Baton Rouge and noticed a trail of oil again and freaked out so I brought the car to Acura of Baton Rouge to get a second look - supposedly everything was fixed but the car wasn't cleaned properly so there was residual dripping.  Needless to say, Acura of Baton Rouge will be doing all maintenance and repairs on my car in the future.  Don't waste your time with this place or you may end up with a messed up engine.
