I have been bringing my dog to this daycare for over a year and am still ecstatic about it. Before we brought our dog to daycare I went to almost every dog daycare in St. Louis, and this is by far the best one I encountered. To be honest, I was nervous about the concept of dog daycare, and this was the only one I felt comfortable leaving him at. 

I chose it because I felt like my dog was really going to be watched carefully, and because of the friendliness of the staff. The owners are very personable, and have several times gone above and beyond to help me. 

With all of the larger packages and discounts they offer I feel like it's also the most affordable place around. 

My dog loves this place more than anything. He is a very high energy border collie, and he comes home from just a half day of play completely exhausted.
