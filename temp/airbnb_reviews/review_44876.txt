It's a decent Walgreens but management really needs to do something about the constant barrage of pan handlers from Degaulle that make a beeline to you right when you get out of your car, asking for money. I would shop here more often, but that honestly makes me feel uncomfortable. Step it up y'all, take back your store and lot.
