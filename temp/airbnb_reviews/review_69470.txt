Went to see Dr Glider and I had a horrible experience, yes he gave me my Medical card but he was rude and he looked like he was bored and did not want to be there. I don't think he even looked at the papers they made me fill out, because he asked if I had my records with me, I told him my fibromyalgia was diagnosed over 10 yrs ago and knew the reports are no longer available, he was hesitant to give me my card, he gave it to me because of my neck surgery and he saw the scar. I have a friend that went to a different doctor and treated them as a patient and they told their doctor that they had no reports and he was fine with that. Even my partner that went with me said he was really rude and looked like he did not want to be there.
