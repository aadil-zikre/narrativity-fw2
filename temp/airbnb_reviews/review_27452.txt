I met Kelly in February 2015 through Club La Madison Health and Fitness Center.  Let me tell you, if you are in need of help like I was, go see her.  Kelly takes a lot of time to study your eating habits and what your medical issues are of you have any.  When I came to her, I had been just diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic.  I was put on meds that made me feel like crap and not myself.
  I had a talk with my I physical therapist, whose wife put out the monthly gym newsletter.  When I found out that she was covered by my insurance for 6 free visits per year, I had to try it and my PT agreed.  I went into with no B.S and all the courage I could.
  To this day I am 76 pounds down and off all my diabetes meds.  I have been given a new leash on life with just the change of my eating habits.  I have come to love different new veggies and new ways to eat food and enjoy it.  I love being called an inspiration by all my friends that I have met through my journey.  My journey isn't over, I have a long way to go.  It is one fought with strength, love and courage and with the support of my family and friends.
