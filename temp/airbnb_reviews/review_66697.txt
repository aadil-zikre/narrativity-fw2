I used Lite Movers yesterday and they were PHENOMENAL. They were extremely careful, knowledgeable, courteous and protective of their surroundings and all of the property, contents, etc. I could not recommend them more enthusiastically to handle all moves. Their price was reasonable and on the low side for all the work that they did - NOTHING was nicked, scratched or harmed in any way, nor were doorways, banisters, etc. chipped or damaged in the process of moving large and heavy objects.
