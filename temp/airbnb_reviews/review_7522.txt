So, I was going to wait until my second or third visit to this new Cheddar's to hammer out a few comments until I saw what some others have been writing on this page.

Let me assure anyone reading this that I had zero complaints and was impressed by the interior, attentive customer service and taste/temperature of my food.

As a matter of fact, the baked potato soup exceeded my expectations and one employee in particular behind the bar made a special point of showing me all my food for takeout before letting me leave. (ALWAYS the right thing to do and about one in 20 employees at various restaurants actually bother to do it)

It was a very enjoyable dinner and I always appreciate casual places like this which offer a diverse selection of good side items.

The experience was such that I was looking forward to coming back when I had more time and some company to dine in and have a drink or two at a spacious and welcoming bar. 

As a matter of fact, while I'm also a fan of the new Doc B's at International Plaza, the design of the Cheddar's bar area is honestly what the Doc B's bar should have looked like!
