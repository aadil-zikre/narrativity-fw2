Being from a different city it's always hard to find good help. We called The Moving boys to help move my husbands grandparents (whom were down sizing)

Being in a different state being the direct contact for this, I assumed things would get rocky some where in communication but the definitely proved me wrong. If I came across any random questions I forgot to ask they were very quick to reply back and/ answer my calls. This completely put me at ease being hours away.

When the big day hit things couldn't have gone any smoother!  They had everything packed very securely so Gram wasn't at all worried about her fine china. They were supper polite and respectful to our family while there which really helped build that trust in such a big move. When they got to the knew home they insured everything is placed in the proper rooms that they were going to. Which definitely took an extra load off our grandparents and ourselves when it came to unpacking them later.

We all know how difficult and meticulous some of our Grandparents can be and they were absolutely amazing when it came to every step of this move. They made everyone feel great about each step and the price was great considering how for they were moving. I would absolutely recommend this company to help move!
