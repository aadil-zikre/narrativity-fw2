That 's very powerful. So you 're definitely a part of that part of that sense of honoring the past and bringing it into the present. That 's amazing. Yeah , and that 's I mean , that 's really what astrology is always about is having that sense of knowingness when you 're doing something and I think it 's useful because you still have to do it. It 's like it 's not pre-made for you. You slept to actualize your potential or your free will or whatever you want to call it , but it 's nice to have some greater sense of meaning and purpose when you 're going about doing some of these things to contextualize yourself within the broader context of the the world and large or history in general. So finally , I 'm going to throw one of these sad Moon out of their questions at you. And I want to ask you. Why do you think astrology matters ? I think it matters because it runs contrary to the prevailing materialistic scientific Paradigm , which usually holds that there 's no meaning or purpose to the cosmos and that everything is just sort of random and chaotic and pointless in some sense. But astrology the fact that astrology exists and that there 's a meaningful correlation between Celestial movements and Earthly events. And that it seems to indicate things important things that will happen in a person 's life before they 've actually happened. It seems to imply that there 's some greater sense of meaning and purpose in the cosmos
