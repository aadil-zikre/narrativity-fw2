I had a very bad first impression of this store and I won't be back because of my first experience. I came in to mail an item and asked if I buy an envelope at the mailing center or from the actual store. The associate Harrison said we buy it in the store and then can come back to the kiosk to pay for it and ship the item. When we came over with the envelope he was assisting another customer which was fine as we had no problem waiting. He looks at us and says that we can go to the cash register and pay for the envelope. He said it with an arrogant tone which made me reply that he told us to come back over here since we need to ship out the item. It didn't make sense to walk across the store, wait in line, pay for the item and then walk all the way back especially since he told us we could do it with him. By the time we walked back from the line, he could have been helping a second costumer so it didn't make sense to do that. When I explained that we were going to stay and wait because we needed to ship out, he paused as if he wanted to say something rude and then said, "okay" with a tone that showed he was annoyed. When we're shipping out the item he begins talking to another associate telling her to make sure no one bothers him because he has work to do in the back. He paused our transaction to have this conversation with her and then leaves and tells the girl to get out receipt because he needs to the job in the back because he is the only one who can do it. 

I felt that this associate was unprofessional because of this reasons and because of him and his attitude, I won't be back in this store.
