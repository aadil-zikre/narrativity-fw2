I used to be a hardcore Dunkin' fan till they opened a Starbucks a stones throw from my house,  but this week I found myself at the beach with only Dunkin' to satisfy my coffee cravings. I was happy to find they offered almond and oat milk since I don't drink any dairy and overall was very pleasantly surprised with their service. 

Both times I went this week, the drive thru line went super fast and the young woman (same both days) working the window was so nice. I have to say the Dunkin's here in Orlando are kind crappy, so this was a nice experience.
