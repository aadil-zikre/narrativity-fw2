Over the last few months China Garden has become my households go to location for Chinese food.

 This place can easily pass for one of the cleanest Chinese take out spots I've ever been to until I saw a disturbing image of a roach in someones lo mein on here. Since the food is just so good and the staff is very friendly, I have decided to write it off as just another Yelp troll since I can not find the review or photo anymore. Every now and then I will catch myself scanning my plate with my fork for any unknown objects or bugs LOL.

I almost forgot to mention how cheap China Garden's food is which is always good in my book! The only con is that they do not offer delivery which would be great for these rainy weather we have been getting lately.
