If you're ever going to go to this place- DONT. Went out for the weekend with my friends. Left my purse on the sink while I went to the bathroom and realized what I had done but when I walked out back into the bathroom later, it was gone. Definitely my fault, however when I went to find a bouncer to ask if they had a lost and found, they said they did not. My cell phone was in my purse, so I decided to use Find my iPhone with a friends phone. When my phone started pinging, the noise was coming from the bouncers closet/ employee only room. When he heard my phone, he went inside the room and came back with my phone "that wasn't in lost and found". He did not come back with the rest of my purse and when I asked why he said "we don't normally give those things back." I proceeded to tell him I'd call the cops and he said he'd only give me my purse back if I left a review on yelp. 

Well, here is your review. I will never go back to this establishment and will tell everyone to never go here either. Good Luck.
