This man is frightening and dangerous. My wife (being new to the neighborhood) went in with a nail in her tire, so they pulled the nail out, charged her $20 and tells her they couldn't repair it. I went back a couple days later to ask why they charged her $20 to pull a nail from a tire that was already off the car, and he became immediately combative and defensive, cursing at me and threatening me. Telling a customer "F$&k you" & "get the F$&k out of my shop", "you don't know a F$&@ing thing about how i run my business" is something I've never experienced before and was really pretty scary. We went to another place who in fact patched the tire free of charge and sent us in our way. I've never had an experience like this and will stay very far away from Duckworth Tires and Mr. Duckworth himself, and would highly suggest you do the same.
