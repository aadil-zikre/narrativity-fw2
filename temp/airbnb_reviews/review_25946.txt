Remember the '90s, when touchless car washes were all the rage because they wouldn't scratch your paint? Then Mike's (Crew) came on the scene and everyone thought these "soft cloths" somehow were better than the old plastic whippers. I'm sure they are, but still dirt and grime gets caught in there, and I just don't think they're as advertised anymore. 

Now that I have a brand new car, I decided I'm not into using the cloth car washes after some questionable results over time with one of the monthly passes on my last dark navy Jeep.

This place was great. I got a kick of high-school nostalgia bringing my car here to use the touchless wash. You just can't find these places anymore, but I'm so glad one still exists. I used the coin-operated bay and only needed $5 to get a good wash. I think as I get back into the groove of using these, it will probably only take $4 to wash my car ... maybe even just the base $3 eventually if it isn't too filthy to start. Great deal!
