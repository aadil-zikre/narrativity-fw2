I can't understand how people could buy a car every couple years I haven't bought a new truck in 10 years and it was a terrible experience I had negotiated before we went into the dealership on the Internet the first thing that happened was that they said they made a mistake online and they didn't charge me some fee  of  about $1200 I had just driven three hours and they knew it The negotiations lasted three hours it was awful.The salesman kept saying how much money they were losing on the truck give me a break Then after all of that after we have negotiated a price when we went to talk to the credit people in the office we found another $300 added to the price we finally worked it out and I did purchase the truck. I  think that I was lied to more than any other time in my life of 60 plus years at Bommarito ford. I would say I was happy with the price but the torture I had to Endure makes me wonder if I made the right decision I know one thing I will never go back to Bommarito Ford
