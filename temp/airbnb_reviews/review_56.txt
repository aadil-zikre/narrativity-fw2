And I love that concept album so much of Hades town and she decided to spend out into a full musical and that became there 's some live recordings of that and actually I started by hearing the live recording and now I 'm trying to go back to the album , but now there 's also a new recording so I 'm trying to make sure I get the whole thing , but I 'm not sure how to follow It all yes. So there 's the live original cast recording and that is actually missing a couple of pieces. I believe I yeah and when I looked and this was a few days ago , it was like part of it was becoming available and people like maybe they were releasing it in chunks or something like that. So there 's Now sort of three different versions , but but you 're saying like they 're all correct. They 're all Hades town that you have different points in its structure. It 's so beautiful Erica. I got a guy I just I I became obsessed with it. So I listened to the concept album years ago and did n't really know what it was and then maybe last year or earlier this year. I found the original cast recording and I just I but I was obsessed with it cuz it 's all the things that I love. It 's all the things that actually the three of us love very much and now and it 's playing on Broadway and I think it just won the Tony is nominated for budget. New musical I think yeah , and I just I 'm gon na go see it. I keep saying I 'm gon na go to New York and do all these things
