We were renovating the kitchen which meant a new sink and faucet, among other things.  I know I am not allowed to make those kinds of decisions so my wife took her designer and spent quite a bit of time here.  When I went to pick up what they ordered, I was overwhelmed by the selection.  I have trouble making the correct decision at Home Depot for basic stuff.  How they came to a decision, I have no idea, but they did.  One lesson I learned is that if you plan to pick up an ordered item on a Saturday morning, you better tell them that so they can get it out of the warehouse on Friday;  the warehouse is closed on Saturday.  One wasted trip to learn this lesson.  On the successful pick up trip, I discovered that a garbage disposal had been included in the order which I didn't know they sold.  They did such a good job working with my wife that she came back here to buy the hardware (handles) for the new cabinets.  I know I'm coming back as I've heard mention of left over kitchen countertop and a guest bathroom makeover.
