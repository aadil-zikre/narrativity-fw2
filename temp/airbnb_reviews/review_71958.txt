Hosting my first Thanksgiving time was running out and I was needed just one thing to be taken off my plate. Bring in Randall's Wine and Spirts Ballwin location. I was hoping to order and do a contactless pick up but to my surprise I was able to order delivery. Not only delivery but super-fast, and very in touch delivery. I received emails and texts with delivery information and could not be more ecstatic. It was such a blessing to have wines, hard liquor, and even some moon shine brought to my house. I did not even know this was possible.

Randall's always goes above and beyond. I do enjoy shopping in the store, but this service is amazing  and above and beyond. Thanks to Randall's I was able to have each family members favorite adult drinks with out having to take time out of the house. This literally made each family member feel extra special that I knew what they each prefer. I will be restocking before Christmas. I also plan on giving a lot of those mini bottles near the cash registers as adult stocking stuffers.
