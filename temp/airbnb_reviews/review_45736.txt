Appalled at the treatment I received here. I was uncomfortable turning in my handbag (my small, short strapped, and very expensive handbag with all of my belongings in it, including an iPad mini, a designer makeup pouch, and additional cash :: this bag is like a Tardis), and had to leave the store for "security and breakage reasons". 

Had there not been a middle aged white woman in there with THREE DOGS on the floor on long leashes I would not be as offended as I am, but I feel that I was profiled for being a young, tattooed woman and therefore suspicious. I only say this because it wasn't until my bare and heavily tattooed legs were in eye line of the audacious women behind the counter (I was greeted with smiles and welcomes, and then took a few steps in) that the size of my handbag was suddenly a major issue and "violates store policy"- this is a direct quote. I am failing to see how my close-to-body purse is a greater liability than three animals roaming around. 

I regret ever recommending this place to visiting friends, and wish I could take back all of the business I've ever given or sent to this grossly overpriced junk shop, including one multiple thousands of dollar sale that I sent a private collector friend in for.

Aside from never stepping foot in that store again and advising others the same, I plan on contacting the oddities dealer that is currently renting booth space to let them know that the very customers going into the store to purchase their items (which I am sure are shelved on a grossly high commission), are being turned away.

I'd also like to add that I was going in to inquire about the "funeral mask" they have in the window, which on closer inspection was not only a fake, but just an over priced piece of Halloween decoration.
