Yeah , the the the comedy for when you use that image is pretty high. Aha. There 's a couple that make guys float around there 's a couple of the shrink ray so that and I saw last night that there 's an achievement actually that if you kill somebody with all the effects of the all the science weapons you get that achievement. So that might be something I 'll grind towards at some point. Yeah , like I could see lucky even even sort of having a combo of weapons World. Maybe you like make somebody float but then you take them down another weapon. So a lot of options there for the combat. Yeah. Yeah , it definitely balanced out. It 's so story-driven so story heavy , but I do n't think the combats lacking in the ways that people were scared. We 're a little scared of going into It now got the the Gunplay is fine. The combat is is great
