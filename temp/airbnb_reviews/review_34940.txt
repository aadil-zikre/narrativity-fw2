I work at Temple University and often give blood when there are blood drives on campus. Typically when I go to these blood drives the Red Cross staff are extremely rude, disinterested, and they complain the whole time. Usually it's like THEY'RE doing YOU a favor, when really they should express appreciation for the time you've taken from your day to make a DONATION. I've spoken with my colleagues about how the attitudes of the Red Cross staff are very off putting and almost make it so that I DON'T want to give blood. I know I am not the only one who feels this way.

But alas, I always donate.

Today was another such blood drive, but it was a completely different experience than what I usually endure.

Eric Miller, an older white man with a slight studder, is officially nominated by me as "Best Red Cross Employee, Ever." This gentle man explained every single step as he was doing it (despite the fact that this wasn't my first rodeo). There weren't any other donors around when I was there, and rather than walk away and go sit on his phone or chat with colleagues, Eric stood by my table the whole time and chatted with me. We talked about a wide variety of things, and I honestly learned a lot about what the Red Cross does and why they do it.

Anyway, your experience at this center or at a regional blood drive really depends on the person that's taking your blood. Eric is an exemplary employee and has redeemed my faith in the folks that the Red Cross hires.
