I would like to say if you can wait 3-4 weeks after placing and paying for your order until delivery at your destination, you will not be disappointed.  The prices, guarantees and customer service I experienced were outstanding over what I have previously read here at Yelp.  I purchased five appliances and all of my order arrived unblemished.  They shipped from Illinois to northern California.  I was able to track my shipment via Fed Ex based on the tracking number supplied by Number1Direct.  You need to read and understand the procedures for receiving your order so you don't run into circumstances where you feel deceived.  Unpacking each appliance at time of delivery is mandatory to ensure you do not sign for goods received that you later find damaged.  The vendor lays out the procedures very well and their Customer Service, I found, was very helpful in answering my questions, so I would not be disappointed in case an appliance was delivered damaged.  All in all, I found this vendor to be the best in price, guarantees, delivery options and packing of products.  Don't pass up a great opportunity to purchase the applicances you desire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  FIVE STARS based on my experience with Number1Direct.
