That was like , oh you 're a great person and I think that to practice self-love is to find Value in yourself , whether it 's a tiny little thing or a really big thing and for people just learning like yourself about self-love itself. It 's a lot of cells in there. It's just one little thing, whether it be like "I'm a really good cook" or "I'm" and then as that sort of snowballs and you tend to, but I love the way that I do my relationships. I love the way that I mother or I 'd parent I love the way I am as a partner and finding those little pieces and every day noticing what they are and making an effort to continually do that. Yeah , and I guess for me I practice it as a snowball effect. So I try and pick one thing that I 'm good at or I find valuable within myself and who I want to be because we 're always reaching to be who we want to be as As a person and striving to be the best that we can yeah , so I like to pick so for me , okay my relationships with my friends. I try really hard to make sure that I nurture those relationships because I think I 'm a good friend. But you also know I liked it. I love to give and I love to be there for them when they 're there for me , too. So , yeah , it sure does try and touch base with one or two girlfriends. I 'll just give him a call on the phone and be like hey , like even like when you guys started the podcast , you know after that after listening to the first one , I just I go I literally just like I loved it and I was like I 'm gon na call and tell them because to me that 's a nice thing to do and that brings so much joy to other people and I guess people do n't understand that the values that they have within themselves actually can Inspire and be so amazing for other people to hear.
