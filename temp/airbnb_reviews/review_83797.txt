I have gone to Larmon about 4 times in the last few months and I have not been happy with their customer service. I had some pictures enlarged and when I got in the car to look at them, I realized they cut off half of the picture. I also uploaded some pictures on their website, and when I picked them up, the top of everyone's head was cut off. I recently took some old large poster-sized photos photos in to be made smaller and when I went to pick them up, they forgot to give me my original prints back and never made the CD of the pictures that I had already paid for, so I had to wait for them to do it. They do nice work, but considering the frustration every time I've gone, I'll be looking for a new place. If you go, just don't be in a hurry, and be sure to check your photos before you leave the store.
