I went to this locations two times and both times the person at the front was very unfriendly and made me feel very uncomfortable while I was friendly and smiled at her. She acted like I was an idiot when I didn't know how to use the tanning check in and turned away a second later to go behind the wall before I could say anything else to her. The next day I came back and the young man ignored me and told me to come back later to set up my account. I left a suggestion online about these two situations and the regional manager emailed me and called me a liar saying "she doesn't believe the young man was unpleasant with me" if that's how they treat conflict, I don't want anything to do with this PF location. I canceled my membership the day I received her slandering email. I won't be returning unless I move back to Washington to my old location.
