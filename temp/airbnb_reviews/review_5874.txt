I had been thinking about getting permanent eyeliner on my upper lid for a while, and realized that it may not happen due to my fear of everything going wrong and regretting the decision immediately after. I went for it anyways, but before I did, I thoroughly researched about others getting it done, and felt satisfied with what I had found out. 
I decided to go to Aesthetic Electrolysis and Skin Care Center after stopping in to scope the place out and found Heather to be very informative and made the idea of permanent eye makeup to be less worrisome. Lillith ultimately was the one who I went to for the procedure, and found her to be extremely personable as well as putting me at ease with her vast knowledge and experience. I trusted her enough to do the work after explaining minimally of what I wanted done, and waited until the end to check out. As soon as I saw my eyes, I knew she had done exactly what I wanted! I could not have been more thrilled with going through with this, and now that I know I do not have to put makeup on everyday, I am ecstatic. 
Personally, I would recommend anyone that is questioning getting their eyes done to do their research and make sure they are comfortable with the idea before going for it. I knew this is what I wanted and not something I would regret later, so I knew it was for me.

Pros:
No more makeup applications or at a minimum
Brightens eyelashes and face without worries of messy makeup
No more having to remove makeup at nighttime
No more straining on the eye to put on or remove (I always had to pull my eye taut to apply)

Cons:
Little pain (if you've had a tattoo done before, it's similar in feeling but it's not as bad as I expected)
Change of mind later (not happening)
Fading perhaps in the next couple of years
Not giving an accurate description of what is wanted, but that didn't happen here.
Fear...which can be subsided after hearing/reading of positive experiences :)
