Not impressed. I have a nice piece of DVF luggage on which the zipper broke. I had taken it in for appraisal and had been quoted a rather steep price. Nonetheless, I appreciate the time and handiwork it takes in making detailed repairs and had agreed to the price and the timeline. The repairs took much longer than the agreed timeline (6 weeks vs 4). The bag came back with a number of scuff marks and imperfections around the zipper for which no explanation nor excuses were made. As much as I appreciate the time put into the repairs, it is my opinion that the price was not fitting of the work done and the poor condition in which the bag was returned to me.

Also, as I opened the bag to pack for a trip, the zipper broke after one slide.  Looks like this was just a really expensive lesson.
