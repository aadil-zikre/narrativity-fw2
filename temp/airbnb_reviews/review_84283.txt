Have been here twice now. Have to admit and agree this is fast food that does not move fast and they don't always get things right or pay attention too well. However it sure beats the fast feeders I grew up with- Mickey D's etc. 

Some interesting options not enough on the vegetarian side in my opinion, but minor flares to old classics and I have yet to be able to completely explore the menu, that many things look good.

The chips are WAY to SALTY and cost extra which I am NOT a fan of, but I like the fact that their habanero fiery salsa tries to be fiery and the many entree choices....which is why this is fast becoming my first choice when it comes to fast food.
