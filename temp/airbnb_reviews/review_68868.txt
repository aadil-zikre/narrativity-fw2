My primary doctor suggested that I go to this practice and I am glad I did. Right now with everything going on, getting in as a new patient takes forever but I was able to get in within 2 weeks. 

My doctor was very knowledgeable about my visit and made me feel at ease with a few options for me to think about and review. 

I was very impressed that during our conversation my doctor mentioned some paperwork she would have the front desk give me and when they didn't, she personally called me to remind me about it and say if I was still there she had it waiting for me. That is normally something done by a nurse or the front desk themselves.
