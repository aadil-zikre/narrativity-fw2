This sandwich is good enough to make you forget about Ash Weds!!

My friend and I left work to go to mass like we did when we were kids but we could only stay so long so we go, get our ashes and then leave.  As we are leaving we Amighetti's and think that is something quick we can bring back to work and the sandwiches there are amazing and a very rare treat.  So we go, they are very nice but looking at us funny as we order our large signature sandwiches and 2 vess cream soda's (it's always a special occasion if you have vess!) and they smile and get us what we want and we leave... 
Needless to say 3 bites in we remember the church, ashes and look at our sandwiches in pitty and figure we now have to go to confession so we finish them!
