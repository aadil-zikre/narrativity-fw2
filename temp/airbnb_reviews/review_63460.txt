I really wanted to like and support a neighborhood business. 
My daughter brought her car in because it was overheating. They replaced the radiator, which they said was cracked and sent her on her way with an estimate to fix several oil leaks amounting to about a thousand dollars. My daughter had the leaks repaired somewhere else for a lot less money, but the car continued to overheat. She has brought the car to someone else, as she is convinced that Richards is not very thorough and overpriced; I am of this mind as well now - she was told that while Richard replaced the radiator, he only replaced one of the hoses, as when the car broke down the day after leaving Richard's, Richard admitted that he "forgot" and replaced one of the hoses, we thought he had replaced all but that one, but apparently, he replaced only that one, after the car came back in the next day; although it is standard to replace all hoses when replacing the radiator. According to the real mechanic who actually fixed the car, Richard did not flush the system when he replaced the radiator, so the car continued to overheat, as the antifreeze was not being circulated due to clogging. 
She brought her car in due to overheating, and about $400 later, she was still overheating, so I imagine that had she brought the car back to Richard, he would have continued to overcharge her and continue to fail at fixing the car properly. Perhaps he took advantage of a younger female? We will likely never know, as we will no longer bring our vehicles there or recommend him as a "friendly, honest, reliable neighborhood mechanic".

To me, they did not seem honest or knowledgeable. I would avoid this place like the plague - if they had a "zero" rating, this would be one.
