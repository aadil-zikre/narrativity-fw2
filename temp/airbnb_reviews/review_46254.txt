The staff was kind caring and worked to meet what our expectation was for memorial flowers. There was a bit of a time crunch but the flowers arrived on time and they even coordinated delivery with funeral home which saved us a call. We did think that it was going to be larger in size, but the result was still really beautiful. The have free delivery as well.
