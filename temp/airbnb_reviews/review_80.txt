You do n't mean I 'm sure that many of them will succeed without labels and like I love this guy Roy Blair and I really want to sign him and he 's amazing if you guys have n't checked out you check out fucking brilliant. It 's like he 's doing that half a million monthly listeners on Spotify my favorite artists. I favored unsigned artist at the moment would slide him in a heartbeat , but they do n't want to do a deal right because they just do n't want to be on any label and I respect that , you know , I mean , but I do feel that. There 's always going to be lame because there 's always going to be artists who need labels to invest in their careers , you know , and you know , there 's always going to be people like Matthew Healy who have Amazing Ideas , you know and need someone to help them execute them , you know , you there 's always going to be the need for collaborators and that 's how what I see my labor is it so it 's really an artist partnership tool. You know , that 's all it. I mean it is a label. It 's a partnership. It 's not about you know , just acquiring rights and not investing and not adding value and not building a career. It 's there. It 's about total investment emotionally financially like creatively , you know , there 's always going to be labeled. So at least at least I think so. Yeah and that translates without even when you 're looking at videos
