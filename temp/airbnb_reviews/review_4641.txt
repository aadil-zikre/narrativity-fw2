The better half decided we were going to start going here to get fresh produce, and I can't say I was disappointed.  The selection is nice, and everyone is extremely friendly.  One small downside is make sure and bring cash, because not all the vendors take Visa.  It seems like mostly the big meat sellers are set up to take credit or debit cards.

Don't let that stop you from coming though.. Fantastic overall!
