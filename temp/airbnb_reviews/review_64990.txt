Definitely time to update my review with all the exciting changes Hub has put into this location.

The place was electrically alive today when I walked in, with The Dropout counter buzzing and a few folks waiting for their drinks, and I had the most pleasurable Hub experience of all time thanks to the friendly and informative barista.

She was in the middle of preparing drinks when I came in and paused to look up and greet me and welcome me warmly to the shop. I asked if Pine Street did Double Down and she said yep, so I started looking at the selection. She kept working on drinks but also kept asking me questions to help me find the right coffee. I always focus on single origins when buying coffee. It's not for any reason other than I enjoy comparing the differences when I drink them. I almost walked out to head to Riverside for a larger selection, but after sharing some of what I was after, she pointed me toward a blend she thought was a good fit. 

It was her knowledge of the blends and quick thinking that got me to leave with Clandestino and the Las Altria's and I'm excited for tomorrow morning! 

This was the first time in a long time I felt like I should've walked back in to get her name because she was a customer service rockstar. So if you're reading this, keep it going. And if you're the ownership, give her a big ol' commendation because she is exceptional!
