Unveiled was my first stop dress shopping, and was exactly what I'd always hoped wedding dress shopping would be! Monet was amazing- she looked through all of the photos I brought of dresses that I liked, and started out by pulling things with the same feel and letting me, my MoH and my mom pull things we liked as well. She was great about budget- any time one of us started looking at something that was above our budget, she immediately let us know. After trying on a few dresses that were similar to the photos I brought without much success, she had me try on one that we'd pull that she thought would really accentuate my figure (A Val Stefani Couture). She gave me such an honest opinion about what styles were most flattering on me, unlike the store I visited after (which is in the same area but will remain nameless). Monet knew that there was another dress that I really wanted to look at before I made my decision, and was not pushy at all- she wanted me to find my perfect dress, regardless of who sold it. I left without a dress to go to my next appointment, but was back in under two hours to get the dress from Monet. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful dress shopping experience- Monet was genuinely as excited as I was when I decided that the Val Stefani was my dress. I really can't emphasize enough how much I want every bride to be to go to Unveiled- even if they don't have your perfect dress, the experience was absolutely amazing!
