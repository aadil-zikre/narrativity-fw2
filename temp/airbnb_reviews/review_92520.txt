You're better off buying a car from a crackhead. Ted "the boss" wanted to sell a car so bad to the point he lied to me and let me leave with a car that wasn't approved for the loan. He then went behind my back two weeks later and ran my credit again with a different bank...when that didn't go through Ted decided he would report my car that I PAID FOR stolen ! I had a cop threatening to put a warrant out for my arrest FOR A CAR I PAID FOR AND HAVE PAPERWORK TO PROVE ALL OF THIS. I went to the dealership...returned the car and all bitch made Ted could do was accuse me of fraud when he's the one that ran my credit  again for a loan without my permission ! I only had this car for a month and he refused to give me my money back. This is the worst experience I've ever had at any business, there's a TON of other dealerships all over Philly do not waste your time!!!!!!!!!!
