It's quite possible that my experience would have hit 5 five stars had I been able to put my boots up on the counter and smoke uh big cigar. Nonetheless, the travel channel on the tube, surprisingly delicious cocktails and charming Cottage Home neighborhood surroundings made up for the difference. 

Walking in to Dorman, you'd think Coors Light and the local VFW all rolled into one - with a tinge of leftover smoke in the air from it's time as a smoke-friendly establishment. Leave your assumptions at the door, because you're going to find anything but Coors in this cozy local beer haven. Highlights of my visit: jukebox, travel channel, laid back, clever cocktails like basil and strawberry and pineapple with pepper simple syrup. Most of all, I think Dorman's location on Cottage Home tugs at my heart with that neighborly Icanwearmypajamasinhere feel.
