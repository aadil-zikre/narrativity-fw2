My friend and I traveled to Louisiana to do some nature photography and spent a day in New Orleans.  It was a Sunday morning and we were looking for a bite to eat.  Being tourists, we headed for Cafe du Monde but found the line snaking into the street.  Little did we know that a treasure of a little place (Meals from the Heart Cafe) was a short walk from there in the French Market.

We arrived as they were opening and received a warm welcome.  I delighted to find they had a veggie omelet in an English muffin and a myriad of hot tea to choose from.  Not only was breakfast delicious (and healthy), but the two gals who ran the place were absolutely delightful and felt like old friends by the time we said our farewells.

We could not have had a better introduction to New Orleans than this.  It is the people you meet along the way that makes travel so memorable and you truly touched my heart with your welcoming and friendly attitude.  I thank you for the good food and the comraderie.  Bon Appetit!
