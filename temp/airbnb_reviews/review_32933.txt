I just realized I needed to update--I no longer go to J. Bangs because my stylist, Morgan, left to open her own place.  And, as I'm loyal to stylists and not salons, had to say sayonara to J.B.  

As far as I know, it's still a good place to go though.  Convenient if you are in the Green Hills (Hillsboro Road) area and I'm pretty sure they take walk-ins.
