While some costume shops may be your go-to for wigs or certain items, I think Miss Claudia's is a wonderful spot for inspiration. It definitely feels like a step back in time in the organized chaos of wigs, suits, belts, ruffled and shiny shorts, vintage jewelry, gypsy skirts, mardi bras, gogo boots, stockings, and so much more. Have patience when you enter this store during a busy season since it's a smaller shop and, as mentioned, it's a spot for a nice browse. 

I've yet to dip my toe in their vintage section, but like any vintage store, if you see something and it fits, scoop it up or it might not be dere no more next time you come in. 

I picked up some fluffy hot pink booty shorts and the perfect flamingo leg stockings for Mardi Gras ( thank God they were open on Lundi Gras). I need to return between costuming and see if I can find something one-of-a-kind for those "quick-throw-on-a-costume" events!
