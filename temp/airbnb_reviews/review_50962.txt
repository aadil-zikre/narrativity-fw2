The drive-thru is very very long I'm getting ready to get out of line to go to another restaurant but why I'm sitting in this line at Wendy's I'm looking at Kentucky is not that crowded Burger King is not that crowded Taco Bell has a long line just like Wendy's. The food is not that great I don't even know why everyone is in this long behind line they must have a mix-up in the restaurant they must don't have enough fries cooking or any Burgers done this is absolutely crazy but it's starting to move now and I also looked down the street and McDonald's is crowded nobody don't want to cook a nice Sunday dinner I just got off of work and I'm tired so I just want to grab something and go home. I still have four or five cars in front of me I can't see all the way around didn't even get to the window to place my order yet hopefully my food is fresh and my fries are hot.
