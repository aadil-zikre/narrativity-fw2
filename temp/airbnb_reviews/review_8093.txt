Dr. Rai seems to be pleasant enough and knowledgable as a professional however I can't fully comment on his hands-on skills since I've only gotten a 15-20min consultation with a price tag of $76 and that's why I'm giving him 3 stars as an "A-ok", but not for the overall experience. His receptionist Kathy or Katie on the other hand can use a customer orientation training. 
When I got bogus charges for services I did not receive I politely asked to verify the  accuracy of records and instead  received rude, condescending attitude and no acknowledgement or apology for the mistakes made on their end in addition to snooty comment "well, that's just the price you pay for living in Santa Barbara". In my opinion "living in Santa Barbara" should not mean poor treatment for high prices, regardless of the high overhead business expenditures hardships that shouldn't spill into irritated desperation for eager customer billing but rather serve as an encouraging guideline to be more customer conscientious, especially in this competitive market economy. 
To make story short, I paid the account under duress after receiving follow up  handwritten note  of encouragement that stated, "please clear  this account, will be sent to collection agency"  on my bill and shall happily never return to the office ever again. Other then that, they did a great job with office renovations that I found to be esthetically pleasing, reminiscent of a spa-like environment and fresh flowers definitely added a nice touch. However, beyond the home-improvement facade, it is the formation of relationships with clients that will continue to bring recurrent business where a secretary/receptionist  plays a crucial role as the face of the company.
