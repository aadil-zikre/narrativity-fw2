Big props to Joseph at the drive-thru window for really representing the Starbucks brand well and pushing for app downloads. He makes for a great brand ambassador! Expect long lines in the drive-through but friendly service. I was surprised and curious to see the sous vide egg and bacon option now on the menu. Located along capital Avenue on your way to downtown the spot seems to be quite popular for those grabbing a coffee before heading into the office.
