It's 7 AM I want my Starbucks I drive to this location a few miles from the hotel order my grande no foam latte. It's all good but something is wrong here no smiling faces everyone looks so unhappy I understand it's early Sunday morning but I really didn't mean to create extra work for anyone by having my foam scooped off the top apparently this is new to the west coast she spilled hot steaming milk all down the side of my cup shoved a sleeve on and handed the dripping mess to me. I was so distraught I wasn't able to speak I walked out open my truck door grabbed my travel mug and dumped it in and trashed the cup and sleeve it wasn't until I drove away that I realized what just happened this is unacceptable now I'm wondering where I go tomorrow :-(
