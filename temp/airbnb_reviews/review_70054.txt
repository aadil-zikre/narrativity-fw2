This is a nice flower shop with friendly employees greeting  me after I walked in the door and asking if I had been there before. I hadn't and am glad she gave me the run down of what's what. I appreciate employees that want to help the customer and even though they might be assembling a floral arrangement they came over to help. They had a lot of arrangements made up in the main area and I personally love the cooler section you can go into. It's like a secret cold flower vault that customers are allowed to go into and they even have a sign customers are allowed in! I know a few other places that have these and I just like them because the flowers seem to be at the right temperature and ready to go. They had a lot of varieties and they had a section you can pick stems and make your own bouquet. 

Overall a nice experience and if you live in the area this would be a great place to order flowers for Mother's Day coming up. They do deliver I'm not sure of the delivery radius. They have a website and I'm sure it would say or they could tell you if you called them. Check them out if you need some colorful flowers to brighten your day or brighten someone else's day!
