I have a confession: Due to being spoiled with a washer/dryer in my past 3 apartments, a lot of generous friends, or frequent trips home to visit the folks, I have never actually been to a laundromat before. I know, I know, 25 years old, I should be ashamed of myself. However, this sunday, with an abundance of time and far too many unwashed garments and sheets, it was time to swallow my pride, don my rarely-worn "laundry day" gear, and walk over to the Washing Well. Lucky for me, that walk is about 1.5 minutes (proximity is everything, people). 

After standing like a confused creature in front of the automated card-distributor for a good three minutes, I finally figured out where to put my credit card, where to take the pre-paid card (when you buy it, you're charged $5 instantly. $3 of those dollars go to the actual card, which I'd recommend NOT losing as it's rechargeable AND your only way to get into the facility if you can't con someone into opening the door for you and $2 go onto the card, prepping you for your first wash!) 

$2/load of washer OR dryer (except $1.50 Wednesdays), I split my clothing up into darks and lights, unsure of how big these machines were. I'd never recommend over-filling, but I will say I grossly underestimated how many clothes could comfortably fit in and probably could've doubled the amount of laundry done on this trip for the exact same cost. About 30-35 minutes in the washing machines, 1 hour in the dryers, and my clothes came out bone dry and smelling fresh as daisies (or, technically, lavenders, courtesy of my dryer sheets). There's a reasonable amount of space to fold your goods, but I lived so close that I just jammed it all back into my bags and strolled back across the street to fold in the comfort of my home. I'll be back, now that I've got my access card. And it'll probably be on a Wednesday.
