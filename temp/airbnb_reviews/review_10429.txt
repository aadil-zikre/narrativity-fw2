I never write online reviews but felt like I had to after my most recent trip to Pep Boys.  I have always felt like this location is a little pushy and overpriced but I was in a pinch for a car inspection and oil change so I figured it would be fine to take it there.  Everything seemed to go fine and they finished everything up in a somewhat timely manner (an hour and a half) and then the typical suggested services started.  I normally turn all these down but they mentioned corrosion on the battery and a simple service to remove it and help save the battery life, 10 minutes, $10, easy fix so I agreed to it.  I left Pep Boys alright with the cost and service and headed to the next shopping center over on my way home.  When I got back in my car, the battery was dead.  I called Pep Boys back and they came over to give me a jump and I brought my car back to them to take a look at it.  They then told me that the battery was bad and I needed to get a new one.  In any other circumstances I wouldn't have been that surprised because my car is around the age where I might need a new battery but it seems like an awfully big coincidence that not even 10 minutes after I have service done on my previously normally functioning battery, I now am back at Pep Boys shelling out another $100 for a new battery.  I will say I appreciated them coming out and jumping my car.  As I said, I have always been leery of Pep Boys in the past and this just solidified my feelings.  I won't be going back to Pep Boys anytime in the near future.
