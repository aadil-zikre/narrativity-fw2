Once again, I went to Auto Glam Detail in Murfreesboro, Tennessee only this time I convinced my girlfriend to give Auto Glam a try. 

Mind you, she has never in her life had a car detailed, at best a full service carwash was her idea of the real deal and she is good about keeping her car clean. Having said that you can imagine the hard sell it was for me to convince her to spend a few extra dollars for not just a car wash but a whole new experience in the art of cosmetic car care.

I set the hook, reeled her to Auto Glam Detail and introduced her to Jason and his team of experts to include his very hard working father who takes extreme pride in everything that he does.

Fast forward:  When we picked up my girlfriend's car and opened up the passenger side car door her first words were, " Oh my God." Upon further inspection she told the workers at Auto Glam Detail, " You guys just earned yourselves another permanent customer because I will be coming here from now on."

Long story short: My girlfriend understands the value of the dollar and she knows a great deal when she sees one. In this case she knows without question that Auto Glam Detail is an investment worth every penny and I guarantee you from her amazement, she will be going back to Auto Glam Detail from this day forward.
