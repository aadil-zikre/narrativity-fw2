When I moved here from Dallas late last year I found myself trying to decide whether I wanted to live in Nashville or Franklin.  When I contacted Crescent they were very responsive, professional and friendly.  In fact, the front office staff and leasing team here at the Crescent were THE deciding factor in my decision to move to the Crescent.  It's a new community that is not even fully leased but the Crescent office team seems to truly care about its residents for they always bend over backwards to make sure things are taken care of as needed.  Kelly, Jessica, Bridgett, and Brittany are truly a wonderful team - I recommend Crescent Cool Springs to anyone moving to the area!
