I went in for a really simple layered/angled cut.  I wish I could remember the girls name who was cutting my hair because maybe she was just one bad stylist.  The front came out uneven and now I feel I have to pin back the front everyday until it grows out more.  I could kind of tell while she was cutting my hair that she wasn't doing it how every other hairstylist I've been to does it.  If you do go here be sure to speak up if it seems your stylist doesn't know what she's doing.
