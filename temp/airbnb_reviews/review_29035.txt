This restaurant is a wonderful breath of fresh air for South Jersey.  Since almost all SJ BYOs are Italian, I used to think that I had to go into Philly in order to have a memorable, new American, small BYO experience...until we tried Blackbird.  We've only been there when it's SJ Restaurant Week (a four-course dinner for $35.  How do you pass that up?), but Chef Alex does something unique by offering optional upgrades to each dish that bring the meal from just another Restaurant Week dinner to a full-on dining experience.  The cuisine is top-notch, creative, new American, the staff is extremely friendly and even remembered us after only one previous visit.  Chef Alex also makes everyone feel like a VIP by walking the floor during dinner service.  An overall incredible experience that saves you a trip across the bridge.
