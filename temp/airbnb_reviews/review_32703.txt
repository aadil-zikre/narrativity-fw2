I heard about this boutique, initially, because of a friend. I was sad to see 'Whats-In-Store' go, but from the posts on facebook about this new store, I had good hopes for its being a worthy successor.

So one fine day, I was strolling down Main Street and saw Jondie across the way, so I crossed on over the street. The window display looked to be promising, so I went in.

Now, I was initially very giddy about the merchandise I saw upon entering, but the complete lack of acknowledgement from EITHER or the employees who were on the floor was disappointing. You can easily throw something from one end of the store to the other, which means it's impossible not to see someone in your store. Another couple came in behind me and they were immediately greeted as I browsed the walls and clothing racks. I will say, they have a LOT of cute stuff, and for reasonable prices, but when the staff completely ignores you, it's very off-putting.

When the other couple came in, the girl behind the register came out and greeted them, and then told them about various sales going on (which she had to read off of a sheet of paper). I'm assuming she meant for me to hear it as well, but it would have made me feel a little more welcome had she come up to ME and told me this.

I liked the merchandise I saw, and I'll probably stop back in the future, but the lack of customer service annoyed me. Had I been properly talked to, I would have given this company another star or two.
