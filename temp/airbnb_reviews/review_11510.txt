Liquid is a Tampa gay bar and pretty much a part of the sleazy Ybor City scene. They have some pretty decent DJ's spinning out some rather good sounds which makes for it being rather lively and decent for dancing. They usually have some twink go-go boys dancing on stage, but to be honest about them, they're sort of in dire need of dance instructions. However, they seem to have a good enough following of gropers shoving their hands and cash inside the crotch of their short-shorts.  

On the downsides, it permits smoking so it can get to be rather smoke filled and foul if not downright mephitic in smell. 

It attracts a rather diverse crowd ranging from the college to the drop out types, a few hip hoppers, some eye candy seeking middle agers, and though the doorman tries to prevent it, a few street people.
