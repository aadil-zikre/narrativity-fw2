I HATE HATE HATE going to the dentist which is why it has taken me three years to go back.  Yes, I know its bad and I really wasn't looking forward to getting lectured by the dentist about my poor dental habits.

This experience at dentex completely changed my mind about the dentist.  No criticisms, just great customer service from the moment I entered to the moment I left.  The staff were so friendly and helpful not to mention the cleaning was one of the most thorough cleanings I have ever gotten.  I look forward to going back in six months!
