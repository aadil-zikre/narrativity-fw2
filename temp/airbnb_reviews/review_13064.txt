I always come here when I have a lot of studying to do and order "the high note" (hot chocolate with a shot of espresso). Because there are so many places to sit, you can stay there and work for hours without feeling like you are taking up someone's seat. They also have yogurt parfaits, bagels, and different varieties of pies to fill you up.
