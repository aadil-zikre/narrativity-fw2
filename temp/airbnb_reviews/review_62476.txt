There aren't really any bad beaches but certainly we can all agree some beaches are better than others, I personally think this beach would be better described as a great location to watch the sunset and less about the beach. I love the beaches on the Gulf Coast of Florida but location is everything - anytime the word "silt" is mentioned when a beach is discussed it raises a flag for me and I immediately lower my expectations and I also make sure I bring an extra pair of flop-flops to walk through the muck to get to the water. 

The parking lot here is awesome being it's a very short walk from anywhere you park to the water, although there's probably never enough parking at any beach I think the number of parking spaces aligns well with the size of this beach. The interior of this small peninsula is filled with sand, small palm trees and benches that are scattered throughout this small area, the entrance to the water is surrounded by a number of larger rocks that can become slippery and may be a challenge for some to navigate (silt promotes algae growth and weeds). The water is warm and clear this time of the year and it's easy to see the rocks that emerge from the silty sand but there are many hidden rocks as well so I choose to wear flip-flops or water shoes. 

I don't want to paint a negative picture, I just don't want you to think this is a sugar sand patch of paradise - if you just want to catch some rays and stake out a small claim near the water this is probably a place you'll love but don't expect to jump up from your beach towel and run out into the water unobstructed, it's more of a stand up and find a path to walk out into the water type of place.

As far as a place to watch the sunset this is a great destination, but if you're still driving here 10 minutes before the sunsets you're gonna miss the event. If your intention is to merely to watch the sun disappear into the water come early and hangout and you'll be rewarded...
