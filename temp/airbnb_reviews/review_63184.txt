New to area... took my 8-1/2 year old Aussie in for a general checkup, and because she'd been itching her ears. We had a very good experience. Office staff was friendly, and Dr. Toepke was great... kind, patient, explained things well, took great care of Olivia.

As a physician (for people) and lifelong animal lover I consider myself somewhat of an educated consumer... I now have a second Aussie, and will of course be visiting Dr. Toepke and his kind office staff again soon.
