Unfortunately, I was able to leave my 12 week old puppy in the car. Gentleman behind the counter asked me to leave stating that unless the dog was a service dog that they were not allowed inside. Yes I understand.

They were friendly enough to bring my sandwich out to me whenever it was finished. The other staff beside the gentleman who took my order even played with the dog a little bit while I stood out in the cold waiting for my sandwich.

The reason I am leaving a poor review is due to the fact that the bread on the sandwich they made me hard enough that it hurt to bite through it... I don't know if it was done in retaliation for me bringing my dog in the store or if they just have bad bread but I don't recommend going here.
