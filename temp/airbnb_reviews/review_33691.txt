My order was super fast and delicious - a chana masala with no dairy.  Mild spiciness but everything they put in worked super well together - I couldn't stop eating it!

As a vegan, I think this place will be a big attraction for me.  The only thing I'd change is that my order didn't come with plastic utensils, which I will remember to ask for next time I order from them (which won't be long from today).
