I gotta say these guys were seriously the best.. I went to about 20 lots in one day and just about all the lots the financing guy or lady would just be too pushy and make me uncomfortable. (We all know how that goes) Well when I went to mountain both the first time and the second to buy the truck I originally looked at it was for one reason, the friendliness and politeness of these gentlemen. They were so not pushy and thoroughly explained all options and worked out an amazing deal for me. They also through in some extra things with my deal that simply couldn't be beat or even come close to else where. This place is a must for your next vehicle purchase!!
