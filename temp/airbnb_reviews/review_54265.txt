Went here three times on a recent trip to nola with my husband.  While the hand grenades might have had something to do with our going back, the biggest reason for the return trips was the live blues music of Big Al Carson and his band.  Great voice, musicians that really know their craft, and Big Al was the consummate performer who got the audience going ever night.  If you go, ask him to play his theme song.  Also, the sweet potatoe fries were awwwsooome - though technically on the Funky Pirate menu, all food is delivered from some place down the street. Minus one point for being overcharged for our drinks two nights in a row (but hey, it's Bourbon Street, they probably figure you can't see straight so you can't tell the difference between one zero or two).  After being berated by people from the daiquiri shops, strip joints, and pop-chart belting bars, the Pirate was something of a refuge on Bourbon St.
