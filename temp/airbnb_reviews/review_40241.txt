Great place for outdoor concerts and to find eternal happy hours at the Green Room!  Located in downtown St. Pete, this place is always popping w/ great music coming through. If you dont' want to hear it loud and heavy - make sure to bring yoru earplugs or find another venue!  Mostly find alt/indie rock bands come through here, but it has been known to host acts like Snoop Dog, etc.
