I love going to Skin Deep and getting my facials by Lacy.  She is so knowledgeable about all the different product lines, has Amazing hands, and really likes to do extractions :-)
I usually get the microderm. facial and when I leave, my skin feels completely different, so smooth and clean.  I feel like I walk out glowing!
As a plus, before I leave she always explains what products would benefit me the most and gives me samples to try...I always love them and end up buying them.
Thanks Lacy!
