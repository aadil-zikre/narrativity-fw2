There are a number of things that will have me avoiding this service station in the future first is the complete lack of service, secondly the traffic at this intersection is horrendous it may be the "city of brotherly love" but not at 8:00 AM on a weekday. Thankfully I wasn't in any big hurry so after spending money here for a fill up I wondered inside and found out quickly that customers are ignored here for the most part after the sale. When I attempted to use the restroom the attendant quickly said " no way" I guess I can somewhat understand this by the number of people hanging out on the corner and along the sidewalk in front of the store but on the other hand I am a paying customer. After waiting 5-6 minutes to merge into traffic I knew this review was going to be less than a positive one.
