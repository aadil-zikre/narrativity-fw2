Excited to visit this spot I saw weeks ago and since I was in the area decided to finally visit. When we walked in the lady behind the counter asked us what we were looking for and I answered "Flower sativa" she aggressively said " I'm sorry but we don't sell marijuana here, it's still illegal in this state, I answered "yes, I know that's why I said flower and not weed", "she then said that many people walk in there thinking they sell marijuana. I was puzzled on the way she approached us I felt was very rude, very poor customer service and made us feel not welcomed at all. As we looked around another customer walked in and the store personnel to my surprise was very nice to her and even gave her a free sample. Once the other customer left, we were looking to try out the dab bar but she kept asking us if there was anything else we needed, as to be rushing us out so we just left. I wouldn't recommend this location... take your money else where. If anyone is looking for good service go to Marley's in West Nashville, they are accommodating and all the staff are knowledgeable & welcoming.
